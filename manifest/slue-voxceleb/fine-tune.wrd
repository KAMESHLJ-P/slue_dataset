and i i don't believe in god no religion says yet i was
the question because of my mother till i was fourteen when i thought about it when i emerged with
from my own culture things changed i i think about it a lot i value our
of god what is a creator the almighty that uh
i don't wanna pinpoint what exactly god is i i didn't see the burning
it's everywhere including the philosophy i think god's everywhere from the
um in portraying a character you project a lot of what you wanna do dramatically so i did a lot with that with the tiger but also when you portray something you're imitating it you're interpreting it so i
of a great art so you have to explore you have to give a
we don't quite know yet maybe we'll throw it away in five years from now maybe five years from now that's all we do i i i i don't know but i'm a novice of that media i got very
you know when i started out my career nobody gave me books like you know i have to write
uh i think i i chose the book because
and done their research put their soul into it it make me want to do some
most of the time i read them that make me want to do a movie not be not necessarily because i think
can measure success in so many ways for me i i rather think i'm i'm myself a
you've been cursed like why why this movie chose me to to to be the vehicle what have i done why do i have to go
it's very hard to judge success i i don't wanna measure success by box office or what or even word of mouth
how i connect and my crew connect with the experience of making it is something else to me every every movie we go through that
with all sincerity that's a success uh what what a way to leave our
oh this one i definitely am proud of the more difficult the more i'm proud of but i love them like all my
little patches of flashback of my memories experience they're all put
theater sometimes in the melodramas or operatic movies i will cry so hard a whole
uh it started from big movie to like your mainstream movies so for a long time it was
between me and sight and sound and i had some theatrical background that helped the traumatic event
just when when i everybody started to listen to me
it's a script computation held by the government i thought i might win some
i pitched them the movie they pitched them to me they say what a a king of
we're gonna make this movie the whole time i was hoping that
uh i told him i spent an hour total in the movie is like the
if you want me to make another movie which i didn't want to end my career i feel like retiring after
says a bad my my older son with make me that trip he sets bad example
so i wanna i did the funeral and i didn't want it have time to to
and when it hit the shopping mall it became a hit i got nervous i think people are gonna lynch me for portraying gay
yeah i had some difficulties some feel hesitated or didn't call back
uh for obvious reasons but i like that kind of work i need to work instead of uh sitting at home feeling bad for myself i need something i need a direction
less of a production stress if make your focus on preserving the performance only
and whatever ambition since you have since the student days all you have to do is finish the day and make sure that
yeah it feels that way it feels like that project that story was to meet the
making the movie is about trusting the tale trusting each other that's
then the second time i met her she took me around in the northern part of wyoming showed me the towns the folks
thing brokeback mountain would be uh same thing with larry when even more
but once i was onboard once she said what she had to say the wyoming way whenever i talk about being gay in wyoming but just wyoming
and the vibe the the feeling of wyoming the the west not the your western movie west but realistic uh rural life of the american west and the spirit of
and the foundation she wants to make sure it's captured uh once
bother us on the script or anything i'm sure she struggled with the script writer early on and that's many years before i was on board but once i start making the movie and it was my movies she would give us notes about don't forget this and that many details like that's just
not not really uh i i did ride with the devil another movie which is a pre western
well it's hard to get the the right the proper finance money to
they met and and herding sheep in the mountain brokeback mountain wyoming tough
one there that gets too colder both in the tent it tipped over they didn't know what happened they thought it was one summer
of become a functional father and husband leave their
and she kept trying to to hide out going back to brokeback mountain because having a life together is not possible
i was surprised scene by scene how they carried the age you know twenty to
put put in regular preparation i want him to carry that western mood
sort of the other side of america we're more familiar with the romantic the
there struck me as he's a uh actor with weight it it really holds your
all i could do for the movie cause i shot it that way the flashback happened twice
then he'd go for precisions cause there's no coverage in this scene i wanna do a one
yeah they just sent and sometimes something magic happened it's not one person's plan they have to correspond to each other
who who knows which one is is the most perfect one i also had to see how it fit with everything else in the movie so i was guessing i always kept doing it kept
me and because the challenge i think the only way to get out of it is they have to be
i think it's i was very moved um um i was hardly moved i was professional i remember uh
they're kind of besides themselves very genuine and i was i was
they feel like a cowboy they feel like ranch hand they know each other so much more
somebody asked me um how do you feel after this shooting this
and on the set i feel right at we're doing a scene it feels quite
i craft a movie and lay it out reveal the story in the way i think nobody knows anything
that knows so much and have anticipations and how do you take that into calculation how do you take that
things are not always in control like you have a thousand sheep
and shooting is like buying groceries you try to get the best ingredient
very exciting about shooting is you prepare for months from your decision to make it to all the way to the day you're shooting that scene it's a long process a lot of anticipation so many people's effort now everything's
and they're not in control you're battling it that moment's very precious especially
that moment is very precious to me i was in altered state which i am not in when i'm just laid back and editing
like in a i can shoot everything they still have to decide but still that's my decision
and help shaping it by observing it and finding it it's a little
and less uh politically really provocative i could get the movie i'm well
uh to do up to my standard in terms of productions that's a
you have to make things happen instead of two hundred people push you forward you push two hundred people you know something like that but it gets easier the more movie
i think the biggest battle is is is culture how do you make it how do you when a movie come out how did
but other than that it is unreal like yeah i feel like a little twilight
the less known material like brokeback mountain attracts me but that's also
you don't think about that person at all just because we're playing such different characters it's not we're not in a dystopian world our you know everything is different about these guys so
coping mechanisms i think that you know one could say that augustus is fearless but
and he is actually very very fearful of of dying without leaving his mark and hazel helps him
it's a like an idealistic way of thinking about things right everyone everyone wants to be not everyone but especially at a young age like you're told that like success is what you want and it you wanna change the world and then as you get
realizing you know even even if you do like leave a mark what does that what's the big deal like as hazel says oblivion is inevitable
um that yeah that's it's an i think it's a natural thing for young people to have so it's realistic that john writes a
any of my heroes that you know were were bad people or something i once heard a funny story someone someone said that they were like a
like a long time ago obviously a big fan of mickey mantle a huge fan and they waited and they waited outside of yankee stadium for him to show up and when he finally did they ran over to him and mickey mickey can i have an
they you know they're not obsessed with van houten they're just hazel's obsessed with this book
they're more you know they don't idolize in that way so when he does sorta spit on them they're sort of like screw you man we don't need you anymore what we have here is more
i read the script about two years ago and i mean it was pretty much simultaneous that the the whole movie hype and the book rose together so it was um perfect timing like i i i actually read
um which was when it was really getting popular and shortly it it became my favorite book and i really really loved it and once i read it i hadn't gotten the role yet and i was like i need to get
i feel like everyone's dealt with cancer indirectly directly um someone they know or they know someone who knows someone um so that makes a story obviously very universal um but then also it's it's a above that it's a beautiful love story and i i think that's what makes our movie so special is that you leave the theater
hopeful and um someone once told me that that once they left the theater that they called everyone they loved and told them that they love
so it really is about appreciating what's in front of you and it's not just a sad story and i think that's
i think that's always very interesting because especially as actors and when we're young and in school all they tell us to do is be natural and be as you know just be as natural as possible but sometimes people in real life have a have a
and i think augustus in the beginning of the story definitely has a bluff and he's over the top and he
that was i think that was important to us because it's not often that a studio movie would have their leading lady having a cannula in their mouth always or on the movie poster let alone and that that's something that hollywood doesn't do very often and we were really proud to to do something like that and really
you know have the the real the main characters be the people with the disease and and show it and like not
crazy feeling but you know i i mean i'm not gonna take credit for anything tom cruise is tom cruise and he's amazing uh it's just our story i think is a really special story and i couldn't be happier that you know that we
when someone said you know you can always make art and make the best art you can but you can never guarantee you'll have an audience for it and something that we're all proud of me my costars shailene and nat um we're so proud because this is something we're all so happy with and proud of and this is the thing that we're getting the most audience for and getting recognized for and that
cause we're forced to take weird jobs or jobs you know because we'll take anything however
right now i'm working on a lot of i always work on ant solo which is my music project i make the house house music and electric dance music um i did a movie with jason reitman who was the director of juno and up in the air and that'll come out next year and that's with adam sandler and emma thompson
you just have to busy yourself with what you love and that's like i said that's one reason why i do make music and i go rock climbing with my friends still and i just do my i go through my normal life um i've really try not to let you know i i haven't changed my lifestyle since all the
um you know i i try to live a normal a normal lifestyle think i think like you know people get in trouble when they just start only
and thinking that now that they're the top of the world they can do anything and but i i i wanna
in this world of divergent when you're sixteen uh you have the option to leave your family and
me and my sister leave our family behind and join different factions based off of who we think we are uh i join the intelligent faction and she joins the brave faction um
has a little problem with the faction my parents are from so that creates a lot of conflict in
i think as an actor you have to relate to you have to find some way of relating to them otherwise it's not gonna be real
right you know i'm not gonna like play him as if he's like being evil or something he's he's being good or he thinks he's being
he thinks erudite is the place that has a a great plan for humanity and peace and um that's why he joins that faction so i had to just bring that out of myself uh the
you know he thinks uh beatrice is coming in there saying and she starts she comes to erudite
in the in the story so it's not that he's being mean it's just that he's defending his new
you know it's just like i loved working with her on divergent um she is
the entire movie i think without shailene this wouldn't work you know any movie where you have someone like that and and you have
uh she's so spectacular so i mean i'm just privileged and lucky enough to be able to have had another product with her that
kid charlie that that comes to uh gets kicked out of private school and comes to a public high school with the intention of
uh he he sort of breaks down the the stereotypes of this school and and
yeah i mean it's tough but it's all there it really is if you if you watch the movie it's all
all in all and charlie are very similar and i think that's what unifies them and that's what makes their sort of their their chess match all the more powerful is that each
needs to learn that he can't always be a parent to himself and he can't always be an adult and that he has to be a kid
to his and sort of clarify what he actually wants from his life you know
i think by facing charlie's the one that puts him face to face with all the the pressures in his life that that are making it unhappy
and and it's almost like i i i think the relationship between gardener and charlie it's it's like it's like a seesaw it's like with parents
uh you know parenting kids in general someone goes down someone goes up someone pushes down and someone comes up and in order to get the seesaw working you both have to be
that was a stunt double who was really awesome uh yeah who was really really they were there
it was hard work and what i have to it was it was it was hard work but it was enjoyable
they're gonna enjoy this film i really think i really think it's it's it's honest
um before that because i wasn't allowed to read the script till a month before we started shooting and so i um
you know on the enterprise and that was as far as it went you know and we talked we talked about billy wilder we had this very nice meeting and then that was it and i didn't hear anything for a couple months and then
i i was told to come in and read and also i couldn't read the sides like usually i get the sides of my house
but here i just had to come in and read them and go in and audition with them so i got these sides and i got some sides from the old um from from some of the old track
i went in and i read them and that was that like i didn't really know anything about chekov either at that
and that was honestly how it stayed up until i got the script and i watched the old shows and i got really into the character and i would talk to jj and ask him sort of um what he wanted to keep and what he wanted to uh get rid of
forum and you have to do your own thing and remain respectful at the same time i think that's the goal of the film is to be its own trek film not just a repeat of what you've already
but remain respectful to the old show and remain entertaining to people who have been fans for this
it it's it's a interesting line to follow because you pick and choose and you see what you can bring that's your own and then i i met with walter koenig and we had the they had this talk and that's really what he said to me and and he said you know it looks like you guys are being really smart about this and doing your own thing and and yet you know i see traces of myself in what you're doing and it was really
it was really great for me to hear that because i was so nervous
you know he he told me about his accent and how he'd get worried about that and
he told me that he felt i had some of the cadences sort of more on the right track and then you know and it was really it was
really pick and choose what i thought was necessary and for me i think the most important thing was to capture that spirit of chekhov you know because he was always this sort of weird comedic relief
and and and really funny and and strange i mean there are episodes where chekov literally is doing no work and macking on his girlfriend the
what you see about him initially pretty much till about half the film is his unyielding
the end through their personalities and how similar they are they help each other they sort of
just speaks to him and murphy naturally gets offended because he's always on the offensive and so he dunks his head in the toilet and the first time charlie sees
i'm always like for making it as real but and sort of weird as possible you know because everything that charlie does has this
he takes things that adults say and sort of translates them into
like their kids wanna be hearing takes what the kids are saying and translate it to what the adults wanna be hearing and that's both
one of these guys like his his name's arnold he's he's one of the like one of the the guys that
and him and his friends all sort of did this thing for me and we did like take after take where i learned from these
do it's selling drugs but at the same time what he does through all of these little things is make this unify the school as a whole and help
what makes charlie cool tighty whities make charlie cool you see everybody wearing boxers right but you
nobody that's seventeen wear tighty whities it's the way to
he's lived to see it his whole life on this space station in mars ever since he was born so he's had a pretty
that he experienced of the outside world pretty much everything he knows is what happens on on mars
finding out about earth which is uh which is something he he loves and he uh he craves that's uh his whole world revolves around this
is to get uh causes him difficulties walking running doing just about anything but he eventually gets used to it
just a sense of belonging which is something we can all really connect with and uh belonging somewhere
which uh gardner really doesn't at the start of the film because no one knows he exists and uh in his words how can he be indispensable if no one
motive about finding somewhere to that he belongs and that he's feels safe is also something i think everyone needs and everyone uh
i mean this this whole uh story so revolves around gardner's and tulsa's
uh yeah me and brad had a lot of fun and uh it's quite uh the way their relationship
through the film it's quite interesting because they both kind of balance each other out as
manic kind of almost energy and gardner is much calmer and kind of um
gary's been amazing fun to work with he's a he's a really nice guy and he's a phenomenal actor as well
an important part of his life and been such an important kind of aspect of who he is um so because of that we really wanted to make sure the relationship was quite sort of fun um although
she is almost his caretaker in a kind of mothery aspect she's all they were almost like siblings so they have that kind of banter and that um lightheartedness which is we both really wanted to capture and make sure it wasn't too um
and who appreciates a good cup of tea so um yeah he's
gardener and um he used to be an actor as well so he really understands acting and he really understands the sort of the way an actor works
though uh when you have that and you have that kind of appreciation from the director and he knows what he's doing then you can trust him a lot more and everything just
was the first one i watched of his i think and it was first one well ronny kind of a scared me as a kid i was quite young when i watched it but i just loved how whacky it was and tim wasn't like afraid to just do what he wanted and make the film he wanted to make and as i got older that was like i really respected that about him as a director he didn't kind of
they're his ideas he never really sort of gave me advice in acting because the it's a very kind of there's
lot of respect given between directors and actors and you gotta have that trust so he trusts my instincts and i trust
is invaluable really as a source material having all of the information is great
in florida and by the end of the film he's he's this hero almost even though he's kinda unconventional and he didn't really mean to be there he still takes upon that role and i think that's admirable and for me tuning into that uh that transition and that decision um even though he's in somewhere where he feels out of place and he
lucky enough to be able to i've been doing big budget movies but i can also do a lot of independent films which uh i enjoy just as much really i just came off a shoot which was a really small budget it was a four week shoot in uh minnesota i was playing this punk bass guitar player and that was so much fun i mean it was hard work cause we were working all day pretty much every day
you know the american accent which is a which is a whole nother thing but thankfully for
except i was surrounded by a british cast and crew which made it quite difficult
you know i mean kinda out of this world i went out every time i came back to the industry and i came back to doing a film i'd grown up a little bit more and i think that was
um i haven't um not for a while i mean i i don't like watching myself
but i did a a couple years ago i would rewatch the boy in the striped pajamas which is the first time i'd seen it in
actually as you can imagine um but but tim even though
and this incredible director who's had such an iconic kinda history he's incredibly down to earth and he's incredibly humble and he's um
process i'd read it just after the script and then i read the next ones as soon as they came out uh they're great books great books i
it is of the audience in the story he's the he's the normal one as
was kinda a story is actually real and so he feels out of place he feels totally uncomfortable and that's
relate to one way or another everyone's been in that position maybe not this
uh uh those there's great parts of everything having the props there and the sets which are so rich and
is incredibly helpful for an actor because you're just kind of in there and you're in the moment and there's no kind of distractions and you feel like you're in this fairytale environment literally
you know imagine this monster is chasing you up the stairs and for me i actually really enjoyed that
playing and uh letting your imagination go wild it's like you know when you're a kid and you you're running up the stairs and you trick yourself that there's something chasing you and you scare yourself that's literally what you're doing and
you have a lot of fun with that when else do you get to do that everyone's so self sensible and serious in real life
making it as sort of songwriters of one off hits they were um they were writing songs for disney shows annette funicello and until finally they were just brought under as the first contract songwriters and one of them uh
full presence on set me he we all came to love him and he told us everything about those days and then of course
and i i suddenly see richard sherman's name all over online all over twitter and my first thought is
worked at that museum although i did some work for it in a way when i was seventeen years old i went to the museum of fine arts in boston with a friend and we took this tour of ancient chinese art and it was one of those audio cassette tours
and we got the idea to make our tour and uh we borrowed one of the tapes from the
mischievous and we went uh back to my my house and we transcribed every
everything was and then we wrote our own tour and we got a kid at our school with a very deep voice a kid from
and you know made new labels and we actually made a batch of fifteen of these
we got a bunch of friends to walk through the museum taking the tour and as they took it they sorta
i told them thinking they'd love it they said you can't do this to the museum i did it anyway and the next day uh at the kitchen table there was a copy of the boston globe which had an article called wild ride through
thing about uh a prank to um to like the picasso exhibit or something cause i wanted to like hide that i knew what was up and they're like oh no no it was the chinese art exhibit wild ride through dragons that's what
uh thing that could ever happen to a standup comic i got heckled with constructive
yeah uh when you see a celebrity autobiography on the shelves and it says with william novak at the bottom that's
found a lot of political people that that weren't so much fun for me as a kid um nancy reagan tip o'neill
i was uh twelve years old it was nineteen ninety one and we were told that a man my father was working with was invited to a dinner at deepak chopra's house in western massachusetts and we were told that michael jackson was going to be
and uh so we showed up to this home in lincoln massachusetts i'm in eighth grade and uh uh we're kind of waiting around at the cocktail hour where kids have nothing to do um but hold michael jackson
and after about forty five minutes a man just runs in and
in a black top hat and mirrored sunglasses and sits behind uh a book on the beatles like a spy in an
i thought well this has to be a michael jackson impersonator because this isn't what michael jackson would ever wear on his date
uh there was no conversation for like two minutes straight everyone was just too shy and then finally he says to me so do you like
and i said yeah and i couldn't make this up he pulls out of his jacket pocket rather than just say i'm michael jackson he pulls out of his coat pocket three
and uh his category was n and i was very impressed because you in the game's categories you have to uh start a word in each category with a
for nicholas nickleby so he's a dickens reader i was very i didn't know who that was at the time it wasn't on my eighth grade list yet and um then when he won he sang two a cappella bars of we are the champions and
says uh i want you to make me a cake in the shape of a letter b the guy says sure come back wednesday we'll have it for you comes back in opens up the cake box says ah i'm so sorry this is my fault i should have explained i needed it to be in the shape of a lower case b so he says alright i i'm sorry i should have asked my fault i'll remake it for free come back friday comes back friday opens the box says oh man i should have specified it has to be in the shape of a lower case cursive b
we'll remake this you pay full price he says absolutely anything i just need it lowercase cursive he comes back monday opens up the cake box the guy says is this what you wanted he says yes thank you oh this is perfect i'm so glad we got it right the store says uh the guy at the store says
the store says uh the guy at the store says okay great i'm so glad we finally got it let me wrap that up for you the guy says no no that's
i think that's exaggerated i think a lot of people love to say oh i was such a nerd or i was
i mean i did my homework and you know dreamed of being a bit of a
where i sat on the bus when i was fourteen i got into my head that i wanted a fake id and i committed
this fake id so this is kind of the i've never told this story before this is pretty much the nerdiest way you can be
full of these and i actually tried to google the statute of limitations on this before the show and couldn't get the wifi
years old i looked up someone who was twenty one who had my same first name and initial because i thought if i get drunk i'd
got my name i can't get busted so i found someone who is named benjamin j something so i found this guy's name and i thought if i can just forge all his
i ask for him i don't know what i would have done i get his brother and i say i work with
dmv and i said oh my i lost my wallet i need to this is all i have and i looked fourteen years old but i have
said you don't even have a picture and then said with a wry smile on her face open your wallet right
and like a true method actor the only thing i had in my wallet was a
it's humidity or heat all that kinda you know often the angle of things but you'd
would love loads of kids i mean somebody said i've gotta wear tighter underpants that's how you get the girl but um i don't know it might be an urban
the girls or their things you gotta wear them tight and that's how you get a female
well he he didn't pass on he he i i didn't have any choice you know uh i remember the first time i i took the train on my own somewhere
i keep bending the staff but um but yes on the whole thing is you know when i have to give it up uh i'll give it up at the moment
well i i wasn't boasting to what happened is that i it was it was a few years ago now i hit thirty i thought it's so mad that i don't want to reach into
there's none of there's none of the kind i've had to survive in the world i've done that as a book and and a lot of people
but what are the things you've learned and and and nobody told me at school stuff like you know how to achieve goals how to thrive when it's difficult how to what sort of
but it is always difficult taking these guys i remember having a phone conversation with the insurance people before we did the will ferrell one and it was like a conference call
hundred percent that we'll be safe i was thinking well do i lie or do i so i went no i can't guarantee you'll be safe but i promise i'll do my best to look after there was like a pause you know um so
um but he he loved it and he really thrived uh the harder it got you know we slept in the
uh you're you're right but actually they they brought out new research that says that and what it does
really you know and i think it's often the unlikely ones that really shine you know and i've also there's no blueprint for a great
you know and and a quiet perseverance and a a quiet courage to keep going you know but often it's a
a streak steal or focus but also if you think about it you know it's just a different
of which you know we always we're lucky we do get some dream guests i mean the the obama one was definitely a sort of a
and said he's a big fan of the show would would you take him to alaska you know so that was
look at the growth of the scouts for example you know it's it's you know people want to be part of an adventure and the scouts are incredible
normally get the chance give them an adventure you know we we try and bring adventure through the tv show through the books i mean i'm doing this live
yeah completely i mean we've spent the whole week rehearsing at the double oh seven stage in pinewood should be an
um but i know this show it's called endeavor i know it would inspire people and and what's amazing is what can you do with this
aerial acrobatic part is is where i recreate crevasse falls avalanches
shows but it's it's all about inspiration you know it's gory in places it's quite
the greatest moments of human endeavor and adventure and exploration and recreate them um so yeah i'm nervous it's funny one of the technicians said to us yesterday he goes do you know what twenty years i've been in seen it all but what you
in love it's a monday morning in the sea i held her in my arms and said shall we begin a
ugh i first i don't feel like a hero to anyone do you know what i'm somebody i love my job i have a few kinda skills that often tells me are pretty useless in everyday
um but i love what i do you know and and to bring the you know what we do to a live arena tour we take it all around the world it's really exciting the
but i think there's something there's something cool about live shows it's very personal even on when it's lots of people uh but it's a cool endeavor and it's totally unlike anything you will have ever seen before it's taken two years putting this together we worked with these cirque du soleil choreographers and using all this live
we did our adventure together in alaska and at the end of it he's very sweet he said i'd love to meet the family bring the kids to the oval office sometime and i kinda thought he was just being polite
in the oval office but as we walked out all the marines who stood there on the way and all been high fiving and great to meet you and all this and stuff on the way they all like suddenly went
basically the white house went into a lockdown which was exactly the time this captor who was shooting there was like and then i think the same day somebody tried to climb the white house fence everyone thought the whole thing's under attack then the marines came in and this person then took us down underground
uh hey listen i think like all great um presidents he makes everyone feel special he certainly i mean i'm a big fan of his i think what he's done for all the climate change stuff has been inspiring
but you know funnily enough the the closer's always a nondramatic ones actually you know we've had all the parachute failures and we saw what the croc does and the sharks the snake bites and pinned in whitewater rapids but actually i remember filming for when we flew paragliders over mount
flew through the the rotor of it of the you know all the wash where it had
lines over everything okay spiraling down i didn't have a reserve parachute on me that day
i really did i was in i was in well i was in kind of sort this out and it all happened very fast and i could just get it to point
knowing i think just you know i knew i should've died that day and it was one of those ones
edition i remember going home and i thought i'm not actually even gonna tell you know shara about
very grateful to be alive across a multitude of things over the years and it's always a focus get home and
um he goes down to find lee and to make everything right and in gotham that never works so uh he finds himself back in the city and we're six months later and uh the monsters who were unleashed on the city
near anarchy in the city so gordon disillusioned with everything really
um he's tracking down these monsters and and bringing them in for a price and he's living a very solitary and and
and bringing them in for a price and he's litiving living a very solitary and and lonely life uh
place for him and um you know it doesn't last forever uh but uh but it allows us to reset the show yet again and to give him a real journey of
he's kind of like one of those i mean because he he did in our version he did serve overseas and he and he did see see war he's kind of one of those guys that wants
his blood he he sort of can't help but seek it out you know he needs that adrenaline
well he's uh he's lonely he's he feels isolated he
the initial goal that he had of cleaning up the city is not even really worth pursuing he's only sort of going about it as a bounty hunter
but he doesn't believe in the cause anymore um and he's gonna have to find
to to believe in a cause again um and the subtitle of the season heroes will fall
espn thing the longhorns have suddenly you know taken over from someone in the a&m you know impending debacle that's sort of happening you follow college
so um yeah so we're we're in good shape now we have to actually win the football game
a shebang i would imagine we did drew was our quarterback i played i played primarily defense uh and then went to rival high schools i went to austin high and he went to westlake high and they proceeded to uh beat the pants off of us
he was although when he went to westlake if i remember correctly i think he had to to work his way back up cause they of course they did not
texas football you know that if you're in a certain district the really good competitive schools will groom the players from elementary school middle school whenever they start playing in the same offensive formations same offensive system all the way through so that by the time they're playing in high school even
modest in it's uh aspirations i guess you might say um i would go
the old name i can't remember it anyway but it was it was not doing well been around for probably
falling apart but yeah man they really put the money by it would be nice if they maybe not to get too uh uh political here but maybe maybe spent twenty million on the stadium
yeah and the look on uh is it maeda is that how you pronounce the yes maeda's face he looked uh
i mean we had how many pitchers as of you know whatever well at least if you go back a year we had mccarthy ryu all these guys and now they're all on the bench uh they're all injured i
you got a couple pitchers who are gonna come up uh i think it's time for julio urias to uh
the dodgers are listening i know they paid close attention to what i say demand julio urias at least at least put him in relief
by the all star break just try him out he's killing it in triple a have you been following
sub two era he's striking out like his his his k to walk is like gotta be three to one four to one
sad because i'm answering work emails but it's just the mlb app oh it's it's really mlb app plus
he's a pro obviously he's done anything and everything and um he's uh he brings such energy to the to the role it's really great i mean between michael who you
um who gets involved trying to help out this
yeah and it and it's and it's both that he's not thinking about things and also that he's he
i have a stressful job um and cops have all kinds of ways of doing
um cause now that he's a cop fully fledged now that he's off probation
he really can't decide what kind of life he wants to lead within the police force he can become john cooper he could become sammy
they're always telling on the show no matter what the characters that you can't be in this life and do this job without getting affected in some way without being hardened in some way without being scarred in some way and and so you know throughout the season he's um he's really put through the wringer towards the end
it is i mean i've had the same partner for the first three seasons cause we told that probationary story but now that we're off um
not very well to be honest even though we're on the same show you know besides hanging out at a few you know press events and stuff i really didn't know him well but he's been a
you know a student teacher relationship and into a peer to peer relationship where two
a lower status person and a higher status person and a constant lesson every week
it's a little more mixed and varied in terms of the stories you can tell and and so we've had a blast and sean's you know awesome
they're well written and they're smart and they're funny but they're really um
i know i know and you know i i what i appreciate most is that um you guys seem to really you know you really know the show and you
you're not afraid to you know pick here and there when when when we're maybe we're not doing things exactly
coming to work uh with with uh with bob i feel comfortable calling him bob finally after
you know basically the idea of the father in law son in law
you know how how you deal with that that guy who's sort of you know giving over his daughter to you
that you know in the you know around the world that people can identify with you wanna impress that person you wanna
so that that i think that combined with just the chemistry between everybody it's just been it feels like it's uh you know had a a very legitimate
i just always uh uh creatively i always just get uh get excited working
the you know kind of uh self pitying sort of thing these little ways that kevin has of manipulating people that greg seems to be the only one to catch on to and the way that he's just such a a rock star in jack's eyes and can not do any wrong
it's barbra streisand you know she's just basically someone who's so her what she's
you know who she is in our culture who you know uh her talents as a singer an actress
you know it's kind of hard to get past that when you're with her and she just i think she is very comfortable with who she is and she brings that aura about her when she comes on the set so uh
i've always am excited to to work with her to be able to call her
think uh they have their own tone and uh i guess so i don't know i mean i think it's a unique thing um and i never know why a movie is successful or not to tell you the truth
and yes of course i mean every time you make a movie you want it to connect with people but somehow these have connected with people i you know i i remember reading the
the uh the making of it did it created this um sort of uh yeah combination of thing
yeah i mean i i they're probably a little old fashioned that way but um you know i think it's that balance where also now the third movie in it's been about eight or nine years since the first movie and these characters have grown and the audience has gotten to know them so there's a you know there's a real history with
you know i've never felt that people try to out gag each other on a movie i mean i think people try
you know you wanna just do your best you wanna you know sort of be you know cause it's someone that you are a fan of you wanna just kind of you know i mean you know like for with robin williams anytime i was ever working with robin i you know i'm such a fan that like i would wanna try to be good
um and it's the same thing with anyone you know uh with uh you know with ricky he's just very very funny and and he's a great improviser and and so you know it's fun to go back and forth but it's uh i think it just keeps you sort of
well he's he made so many great movies and and so many incredible performances and live performances and you know what he did on comic relief and just you know there he just left an incredible amount of work uh behind and um so
and it actually is really cool and it you know we make these movies on the on a set and we shoot them you know for for months during the day and but you know when you actually get to go on location and be in a museum at night you go oh okay i get it this is actually
and and very cool so it was fun he i actually got to go there um last night because we had the premiere and had the party there and it was the same thing it was like do you wanna just go around the corner and just see
i was given the tablet by sean so now i've got it at home and we'll see what it brings to
as i i i was saying it was um we actually wrote the script about five years ago the first draft of it and justin was always in it but he was just sort of a you know sort of this teen pop star and now he has this whole other cultural significance and
he was just ahead of the curve somehow um you know it's just yeah it's it's really interesting to look at it that way when we started thinking about doing the movie thinking about the first one and how much has changed in terms of um social media which just didn't really exist back then and how it's changed our attitudes about ourselves and you know i see it in kids in my kids and just you know it's part of their life so you know it's uh definitely right up derek's
uh it's been fun to sort of you know have him explore that world
and then the line we cut out was and you don't know how you saying that about me makes me feel about
yeah i mean yeah it's you know it it's the it's all it's a part of being human for sure and how much we indulge it and how much you wanna flip your camera phone to you know to selfie
later doing another one it's it's just for me that's i think maybe that's part of what has changed in in how people experience movies is that it was discovered either you know at first through dvd and
don't know i honestly don't know i mean i think part of it might be that you know what we were talking about earlier that you know derrick does sort of
exists in this selfie culture and and you know the narcissism and also the innocence of the character he's a sweet guy he's a sweet innocent guy who really is incredibly self absorbed but
referencing blue steel and and you know cause it's a look also that everybody does when you somebody takes a picture
have i think uh when you're doing comedy of any type you just have to go
i i no i just want i'd like to make a a movie that's that's just sort of you know maybe like a historical thing or something that's like kind of not necessarily uh how to be
um but uh you know he's i know for me he seems more like sort of like like
some people are taking him seriously which is the crazy thing um and i think you know he is um you know i think he's
going with it as long as people keep taking it but i don't see it going uh
how gracious he was uh first of all he had no business being in our movie cause we we i didn't know him alright we just reached out we said hey you know be so cool if david bowie would be the uh walk off judge and and
he helped us by you know he legitimized us by being in the film
it's uh it's alarming and i'm always trying to talk directors into letting me at least wear a jacket i went on stage in new york not only not wearing a jacket but also
took my socks away i mean the length of the we talked more about my whether i should wear socks or not than about
largely when i'm on stage i like you know if you really want the best out of me put me in a lounge suit what we used to call i love the
it means that you know uh do you have lounges in in you know it means like a front room i think well i don't
what you wanna hear about it it's a two piece suit it has a a single vent in the jacket it has a single pleat on the trouser it has a turnup of standard uh depth on each trouser leg it has two back pockets it has adjusters on the waist nothing is
year's eve i do i just get sad um and there's a i think it's because you're scheduled to feel
and that it was the pressure is too much you know and is a b and not only to be happy but at a very
and people were always seemed i my my memories of new year's is always people saying cheer it may never happen you know stuff like that which is enough to make you homicidal but i can't really remember any good ones really i've had some nice lovely ones with my family where where it's nice and easy and you just say
english uh filmmaking um what else would i like to say i'd love to see mississippi burning again for the first time it's one of my favorite films and i it's one of these films where you if you're flipping on tv you just stay there it's like it's like the godfather you just wait
you know what i mean it's like punch drunk love i know it by heart you just stay there cause there's there's nothing gonna be on that's gonna be better than that and mrs
i don't think they were ever gonna be the agents of social change i didn't ever think rock and roll was gonna change the world i just thought it you could dance
uh and i liked it for itself cause i just dig the sound um but uh yeah i mean you know i mean
if they knock on the door and ask to take your daughter anywhere then i think you've you have every right to worry but apart from that i think you have a
right when the sex pistols came out and i was old enough then you know to view it with a weather eye and you saw that the whole of english society went mental because these four kids you know malcom
and got up and said thank god the uh god bless the queen she's a fascist regime uh the great thing about england is that or in or in america you can say that it's
don't i try and avoid them i used to read reviews but uh it's dangerous reading reviews and i'm i'm a
your side and you read them you become too wonderful for your own good i
it's quite it's lately it's been complicated we've been pretty lucky but yeah it's a funny old job and it's a strain
family and things it's difficult to organize sometimes you know but it we we rub along you know we do pretty well and she's quite remarkable in the way that she
so i was pleased in that respect it's a very wonderful part for me and uh i play with stella gonet who your viewers might be familiar with from the house of eliott she played beatrice in the house of eliott she's a wonderful actress and the bulk of the of the evening is she and i together and it's um and i'm extremely grateful that i've got somebody like stella to work with because uh it helps an enormous amount
a sex symbol before the men's room i used to have no trouble at all going up the shops or walking down the
got to work with some terrific people everyone on there it was it wasn't just about the fact that i'd got to drop
i mean i suppose in your i suppose you everybody dreams of being famous in fact i know a few uh properly famous people and it's not much fun unless you're
way i'm just nicely recognizable in the town in which i live which is
those circumstances i think it's you you should be grateful it's a very tough business and you should be grateful to be remembered for anything as long as it's something favorable you know and the men's room was a was a very respectable stab at trying to examine people's lives and how they carry on and men and women and with the emphasis on how relations between men and women and it was an honest
to look at those things and people responded to it and it hit a particular spot um and also i think that the way in which we did all the bedroom stuff it wasn't simply uh it wasn't that stuff where there's a marvelous soundtrack everybody does the right thing it
do in every area yeah and it was um and that we all get led up the garden path by and that we
absolutely yeah it's called now it's called fairytale: a true story it stars harvey harvey keitel and peter o'toole and uh
nick theft dad's camera took it down to the bottom of the garden and apparently took
he had them published in a big magazine at the time called the strand magazine and they became a huge sensation uh and it all blew up in the girls' faces
they were taken very seriously these pictures and as as you say they didn't come clean about them they didn't want to disappoint my character edward gardner they didn't
i knew nothing about the story and i've never met anyone else who knew anything about the story
uh and it's amazing given that it's such a great story that
incredible my reaction to the script was uh i thought it was one of the best scripts i'd ever read in
really that someone has been able to and has taken the time to make something
and is about something important a couple of things important things
the the great developments in my lifetime that make you obscurely proud to have been around are the emancipation of gay men and women in the civil rights movement in america those are the things that
ff you were asked at gunpoint you know what do you think about your generation and other what do you think the great achievement was well those uh two things you would probably reach for first and then the miner strike which was
not really about giving up hope but you know what i mean there were so few things that give you that feeling
gratitude really that someone has been able to and has taken the time to make something
in an accurate manner at least you know a part of it and to have those two stories
uh so you know everything about it was attractive and i just badly wanted
i think it i think it's really really important and i think it's sort of good
it you know the the story travels information travels well and fast in joke form and
the only reason people don't do it is cause they can't because there aren't many people like stephen beresford there are very few people that can write proper
kneejerk reactions to certain words or bodily functions real jokes real proper wit there is so few because like in everything else you know like there is
good painting it's you know and it and and and people who can write really funny things are extremely rare
and steven can so he does and it's a but it's a great way of delivering the
they have a great time hearing about it and and they
although i thought oh well i love working with imelda working with imelda is heavenly it's sort of actually dreamy i've worked with
and she is a great woman she's a great woman and she's a and i say it quite seriously she's a and she's a wonderful
you'll find some that can maybe match her but there's there's no need for anymore talent
but almost with talent and she's also just incredibly
um easy and dreamy to be around she's just you you you never she's one of those few people that you
when i finished reading it i thought um i was kind of uh
they didn't think i was gonna do a play at this point of where i was at and i told my agent in you know kind of cliff notes what the play was about you know and this speech is about having a baby and this is uh i have an you know describe an erection
that i really connected to that experience that isolates an
he can't describe it so uh that kind of experience i've felt that i have had and i've felt passionately about certain things that no one else
into a passion of something that you know you are not gonna be dislodged from you know that no one can
it it enough that would dissuade you from it and that that's probably closer to what i
uh at times sometimes they think it's creepy sometimes they think it's hilarious and like a big feydeau farce and other times they think it's like a
and it's it's just huge and sometimes at the same moment different pockets of the
people in sitting in front of them you know they have their own sense of being within this uh congress of people you know and then they have their own uh recognition that they're reacting differently than somebody else around them and we had the we kinda put this to edward a lot in previews when it was pretty much like a rock and roll thing too it
you try to tell them you try to be honest with them and what do they do they
you know it it changes every fifteen minutes that's the thing about the flag it's kinda
broadway experience i did off broadway when i started out you know in new york that was eighteen years ago so for me i'm kind of
yeah that much i really do like it so much iyou know my wife who's seen the play about nine times now just last time that's the only the first thing she said is it's a different kinda animal that likes to
there's a certain segment that really wants to be vocal about how they feel about the male female
and they participate with it and and that always fuels me i mean as being the outsider who has most of the dislikable things to
you know almost like it's happening in my dream i don't really i can't say it feels like it's you know directly linked to how i'm saying the words
of their hostility which kinda makes me get more
i didn't think i was gonna do a play at this point of where i was at and i told my agent in you know kind of cliff notes what the play was about you know and this speech is about having a baby
you can't describe it so uh that kind of experience i've felt that i have had and i've felt passionately about certain things that no one else
come into a passion of something that you know you're not gonna be dislodged from you know that no one can
in enough that would dissuade you from it and that that's probably closer to what i had
well you know fortunately these are people who uh part of their interest in wine is is telling people about wine and telling people about making wines and they
you think it'd be enough just to grow uh the grapes and make a good wine but
um it's all about telling people what you're doing why you're doing it so that would they were
to get a lot of information from it i mean it wasn't like they were trying to withhold it or any kind of grandma's recipe
yeah but i have always had this little thing about labels
it's the curiosity of fashioning something that you've made putting a label on
operation so every many many christmases we've made
well we've done everything cause we have a ranch in montana so uh and there's
and done that but i mean we also have in california we have a lot of i love to uh the climate in california intoxicated me when i
and the experience of walking down a street with another actor and he said do you wanna
oh i'd love an orange she'd go and walked into someone's yard full of
and just pulled off an orange and gave it to me i said what are you doing this is somebody's house and these are
no they don't even bother to pick the fruit here it's our they wanna drive in their car to a grocery store and buy the fruit and that feels better to them so we get to ha
and uh and i thought wow this fruit is an orange i can eat oranges
we uh realized that uh the now ex president thomas whitmore
is this true with others who had some kinda telepathic engagement with the aliens there was uh there remained some psychic disturbance and
widmore's still a hero to the world but he's been somewhat sequestered off by his close
to uh because he's he's convinced that uh with his visions and
intuitions that they're coming back and no one
i think the the when you begin to sense what the cgi is and all of the uh components that go into what uh scale uh can be done on a film these days you see how
certain scenes i'm in but he's come from scenes with other actors and he seems to be able to go
for a long day of you know eighteen twenty hours a day
i remember in january uh after we'd made it in january of the year that it got released
uh seeing some list in a newspaper about the twenty top movies that are gonna be coming this summer you know and they used to have more of the tentpole movies were all packed in
and then um april came around and saw i saw another list and i went hey wait a minute this is of these ten we're in the ten now well that's good uh we're coming up and then they started to run
trailers of uh you know for the movie which was you know july second they came july third they attacked july fourth the day we fought back white house boom you know
it then escalated like a rocket and you i realized wow this thing has got some
i really liked the fact that it always rested
roland's conviction and not the way that we do it and how we do it and everything his roland and dean together you know wanting to um feel like they got the story right
to a sequel uh just because everybody told him it was a good idea and it had money behind it or something you know it really was for them we did we had such a ride on the first one we we could
you know rub some dirt into it if we failed with a sequel so i it was really exciting to get cooked up for this year because it meant that roland and and and
different times where uh you know i'll walk into a bathroom like a public bathroom in seattle or something and i'll see the speech written uh uh some quote from it on there and or you know thomas whitmore for president or you know just little graffiti here and there of
roland's energy and his real sense of how the story the direness of the situation never is far from his mind
i think you know uh dean always talks about the great love that that you encounter in with different characters and their engagement with other
um other people and it's a really humanistic embrace of uh who we are and our foibles of who we are and the kind of ridiculousness of what we can how we can act in this face of incredible adversity and yet somehow uh the
is involved uh uh you know now the the stakes are higher
and um the vision of what's possible what has to be done is
almost every season of the voice we try to uh change it up a little bit as
you know i'm i'm a little bit intimidated i'm afraid i'm just gonna tell you
it's not like we just randomly have two girls on the show i mean this is alicia keys and miley
you know it might be the only prayer that adam and i have uh at a victory this season it
show and we're going up against two rookies basically as coaches you know i mean i that is proven in the in the past to
outside of season one when they show their first season and so uh we definitely have that little that little
hope that we can pull out another victory this season but i i do have a feeling that the blinds are gonna be
atanding up there on that blind audition stage and i can see adam levine or blake
it's gonna be tough i think to get some of these artists away from him because not only are they new and shiny
also so incredibly talented and they've kinda blazed their own path and that's what you
country music credibility no question about it not only because of her dad but
uh but i hope she's i hope she's not over confident
the thing i think's gonna surprise people out there about miley
it's one thing for her just to be a good singer and a great performer but she's also has this ear for music and and great ideas and great visions not only for herself for other artists we saw
what they were doing as their performance she had a million ideas and and
not only articulate it to them but could sing it to them and that's what blew me away i'm still not good at that
creative personality uh for the show where i think that the other three coaches me miley and adam were were kinda in your
it's a little more laid back and she's really focused on her music you know and so uh i think that's gonna be very appealing to a lot of these artists whenever they you know have a chance to to get the opportunity to work with her if she hits her
those great songs that she's written and that all those great performances that nobody forgets on award shows and things i mean she is
and i thought about this i i gotta say that if i was an artist and got four chairs to turn it would be hard for me not to pick alicia keys as my
a song by so and so and i ran into this same problem and here's what i did or
the way i would perform this song would be like this because one time years ago i did whatever he
you're able to put your own experiences into play to help another artist
it's new to me every season because it's new people that's that's the thing that i can't
emphasize enough is this show it does have a format but every
it's new artists that come and and try out and this show's about the artists that audition
and so we have a new storyline every season and it's it's so exciting
perform but about how they sound when they sing and that's that's where it should start in music bottom line that's where it should start if you wanna be
music uh definitely has a lot of those elements in it like we had with uh the barn and grill album and and my my first two or three albums god i don't even know the names of those albums anymore but
to this thing and then like two days before it's time they're like oh yeah we need an album title and you're like album title
no a neon light at the end of the tunnel i mean if you've had a bad experience which you probably never have
have had some bad experiences and it's always brings me
when i get to a bar and start drinking i mean you gotta have
learned to be i've learned that being patient truly pays off it's not being patient isn't just
and let her you know let her be upset for a minute and don't freak out i mean it's like the ultimate like the long run just being
thank you and yes they are blind in fact i'll go on record right now and say that uh that you know people magazine lost every ounce of credibility they ever had by knowing they had the opportunity to either choose me with both of these
you're like oh man we're just gonna roll over these people they don't have they don't cause it really is you figure out how to play this game as far as getting artists to come over to your team
they did unbelievable in in the blind auditions i mean we've already filmed all that and and there was a time or two where adam we're looking at each other like now this is this is our show
just i mean he's been a coach his whole life anyway basically you know finding stars and producing records and writing songs so he's gonna do great and and people will fall in love with gwen
the second they see her or hear her talk you know it's gonna be tough it's gonna be a tough year i i'm i'm really looking forward to adam losing i don't care as so much as if i win as long as he
on the on the set that day and uh and she said she goes man i made the record i listened
burden why can't i just call it what it is you know and i i i love that i mean it
it's taking us it's taking a stand of for where she feels like she is right now
uh she's great at whatever she does i i never have understood you know the concept of
or cornered into a situation and and nobody can take you seriously if you step out of that zone i mean if anybody can do it it's taylor and why the hell wouldn't she do it it sounds pop we all know it sounds pop and she knows it and and it's awesome i mean it's incredible so care what
uh you'll need a pillow put in your put in your shirt let's just be honest have that thing hanging out
we never planned on writing a song together uh it it it well i i tell you how that song came about it was uh last fall
because you know she wrote you know gwen's a a writer and that's
i bet if she could sit down and pick out her number one favorite thing to do it wouldn't be singing or fashion it would be writing music you know
i can do that too you know and so i i started this song and and i'm
yeah and it was like whoa we wrote a song together you know when i say sent it to her i mean like on voice memo and forward it yeah that's
sat down in a room and and wrote that song it was just back and forth over our phones it and uh and so
sit down and made a little work tape of it at some point you know we were hanging out and and i played it for my sister and my mom and i think she played it for some people in her family and everybody was going oh my god that's a cool song y'all should record that and it's like man why screw it why the hell not we should you know it's it's a part of this story really and and so we did and i never would have imagined i hoped it would blow up you know uh you always hope that about every song but i i never would have
thing this like living thing on on its own you know after that voice
was going on you know as a which was you know at the time she and i were both
uh you know a little bit of trust issues because we of of what we had been through and you know basically
and to go am i really gonna do this again are we am i really about to jump right back into you know another relationship and
i know you're going to you're gonna break my heart i know you're going to so why don't you just go ahead and get it
yeah because we were so excited about it we we couldn't wait to watch that thing
yeah i mean we immediately after we recorded you know and and performed the song on the show uh we went back and
you know it was one of those things where it's a little bit embarrassing and a little bit exciting you know we were having a tough time not smiling at each other while we were singing this sad song you know it's a heartbreak song and uh then we had a hard time keeping the smirks off of our
well first and foremost al i just did a play with al and he called me up and he asked me if he i wanted you know if i had any interest in playing his
you know what do you say of course you say yes and then i read the script and i just thought the script was just beautiful and just
and uh and i liked crazy stupid love very much and and he just had a really clear vision about the movie and i liked how hard he worked on it
it was very cool and very and you know and it was al's idea you know al wanted to play levene and he wanted me to play ricky roma and so he really started the whole thing
it's really it's it's a matter of timing really and and it sometimes timing just works in this business and you know because we did the play together we got very close doing the play we got very close and became very good friends and and the movie came happened right afterwards and
um i didn't know jennifer um uh but jennifer's a fantastic actress and she's she's a mom and i'm a dad and so you know you find things when you don't know somebody and you're all of a sudden thrown into the fire with them you find things that you have in common and you know we both enjoy really love being parents and and
and and we just developed a really good chemistry together also because al al had
so we got to know each other that way and and really the the the the atmosphere around the movie was was just cultivated really nicely by al and by dan fogelman dinners here and there and and and you know going to al's house and uh jennifer and i went with our little girl in
we just spend time together you know in the little time that we did have and um and she's just such an open and honest actress that you know i'm not surprised
was a moment we we we we did play with the ending in
in terms of what we were gonna see um i i think really the big question we knew that we knew that al's character was gonna say that thing about if he calls you tom or if he calls you mr donnelly what we didn't know was if we were gonna ever see the doctor again and how we were gonna like what what the last we were gonna see
and there was a lot of discussion about that and and i really like i really like that you don't see the
twenty year old when he was first born um yeah and i was just auditioning and i needed you know i had to work and
rose's dad's name is robin and rocco i just always liked the name and i thought it i thought it went pretty well with the last
it's the chief thing yeah not a lot of sleep and you know you have a lot of like weird conversations you know you when you have a a small child like that who can't understand anything you're saying right of course but you don't
you you treat them like they do understand you so you know i hear rose having these conversations and i know there's nobody in the house except for this week old baby and you're hearing like you know well why don't you put your hand through the little thing
like to cook so like i have them there and i i i just like having them around me you know and i like having them on my body so
his own record label and the label's in trouble financially and um and he's at a crossroads really like his partners want him to sell it and he refuses to um and he wants it so he's got to find the next big thing and he's done it before and he's gonna do it again or
nineteen seventy three in particular um in that year punk disco and hip hop were all started all started here in new york city um and so
and you know you'll you'll see bands that you know um we'll recreate some bands like led zeppelin's in the pilot and david bowie's in the show and uh jimmy jagger uh you know mick's boy um he plays a a proto punk rocker named kip stevens in the in the show and so you'll hear some
i had to i was doing a play here and they said you know mick you gotta meet mick and i said no i know i know i said but i can't go to la i couldn't fly to la and uh cause i was doing this play and i said well how about we skype and so i skyped with him and i was really nervous and i
and i i think i i freaked him out you know cause he only knew me from boardwalk empire and so
and i think he got a little freaked out he was a little uh i was a little intimidating so it
and then uh went back to his hotel and hung out with him uh for most of the night and uh
that's the chief thing yeah not a lot of sleep and you know you have a lot of like weird conversations you know you when you have a a small child like that who can't understand anything you're saying right of course but you don't
you you treat them like they do understand you so you know i hear rose having these conversations and i know there's nobody in the house except for this week old baby and you're hearing like you know well why don't you put your hand through the little thing
hold them you know i have uh pretty big hands and so i um i love to just carry them around um and i just do everything with them you know and i put them in the bjorn and i
i like to cook so like i have him there and uh i i just like having him around me
his own record label and the label's in trouble financially and um and he's at a crossroads really like his partners want him to sell it and he refuses to um and he wants it so he's gotta find the next big thing and he's done it before and he's gonna do it again or
and you know you'll you'll see bands that you know um we'll recreate some bands like led zeppelin
know and uh jimmy jagger uh you know mick's boy um he plays a a proto punk rocker named kip stevens in the in the show and so you'll hear some music that you've
rose's dad's name is robin and rocco i just always liked the name and i thought it i thought it went pretty well with the last
first born uh my my first son uh my twenty year old when he was first born um yeah and i was just auditioning and i needed a you know i had to work and
really easy decision but really mostly it it was it was uh it was an easy decision to make because of paul
and it was funny cause i had i had just seen guardians of the galaxy with my son and i i was so impressed with it and i was so impressed with how funny it was
you know the great characters in the marvel universe but it had this sort of weird little edge to it that i really enjoyed and and i just thought well with paul playing
i was really psyched to be in um in a movie that wasn't in a superhero movie that wasn't just about flying and lifting
um i i i think the idea of what they can do with the um with the special effects with this character is really just kind of really exciting thing and and um and of course michael douglas playing the original dr pym is um
asked him you know i mean i think you know any any time you know you get offered a movie you know you look at all those
what the story is of course and and who's involved and you know when you see people like michael douglas and paul rudd get involved evangela
um uh corey stoll who i'm a big fan of uh back in new york um it was pretty easy to just throw my hat in the ring and say i i i wanna be
yes so i played jim paxton and um he's a he's a police officer with the san francisco police department
is um about to get to married to scott lang's ex wife paul rudd's character's ex
um and so um my character's about to get married and he's sort of formed this great little home
and he's devoted to both cassie and maggie and um is pretty intent in keeping that that home uh safe and
and um really a safe place for the girls and um and when we when we pick up the story here scot's just gotten out of jail where he's sort of been in and out of jail
that he sort of keep whatever nonsense he's involved with away from this family that he's trying to
can take something that seems sort of sort of very um
just quirky and uh and unlike uh unlike anything else that you would have expected to
expected to have seen when you read when you read the scene um she's really really really
uh really talented and really um just a creative actress and so that's always fun to be able to get to
payton really is a is a great captain of the ship you know he's a lot of fun and you know he has some great ideas and and he's really um he's really just open to um open to us really having fun with it and really playing
and the offer came in i understand it was immediately and he he went out the same day i think to
and he immediately said yes so you know john has said that we just said yes in the same week well like once you come to the end you say uh yeah please because it's just brilliantly
he it's kind of it's a it is actually a sore spot and of course that's why boy keeps twisting that
i think the thing with gerry boyle is that went in i've been trying to kind of come with to a back story with him or i did ages
he he basically i think went into the with a feeling i think he grew up without a man that's my takeaway in the house that the mother uh brought him up the father was away for whatever reason or gone
and that he had a notion of male heroism that was kinda gleaned from movies and he kind of in some way felt that he'd be up to a gary cooper type scene in high noon walking down the street against the baddies in some odd idealistic way this was kind of way he went into the guards and he saw guys in there that were kind of you know desk jockeys and were just looking out the window and were you know avoiding things and turning a blind eye and maybe putting a few bob in the back
and integrity you just threw it out in people's faces um so political correctness was the other thing and something like racism i he's not remotely racist in my taking out but just he'll just throw it at
you know not to want to hear or duh duh duh in a way he just throws it out to see what people will do and i think all the time he's yearning to find somebody who's gonna actually
and really hard on ourselves in terms of what the standards are like in bruges is a brilliantly written script that's why it worked it wasn't because it was irish and in fact in
two english guys and actually two cockneys and martin reluctantly changed them you know when eventually that's where the casting was going to go eh cause he was hoping kind of so in fact everybody thought it was really dublin humor or it was really the irish humor it was actually written for two cockneys now kind of martin's relationship with ireland anyway is kind of pretty intermingled so it's all it's
to continue to be that was really important we keep doing it
uh i don't know we just have to work really hard though at at kinda making sure that the
for stuff that actually when when stuff needs to be hauled in if it's writing or if it's whatever it is stuff that we make
it's been postponed so so often but obviously i'm bragging about it terry you know it's a big chance and i have to you know after making all these statements you know i have to make sure that everything i
though i don't leave stones unturned and then just hope hope that the magic remains in the can when we get into the editing room and finishing it so we just hope for the
so it is the odd setting i don't think he's bothered by the lack of respect um uh but everybody can see
the number of allegations that came up with priests being rather accused for
think of how horrific that must be well i again i think it's to do with more than even that one of the things i love in the film is where
him uh what was he talking about he seemed too deep in conversation and even now as a as a middle aged to
that's lost and bring it to its mother but you have to be careful about how you interact with children that you don't know there's something weird happening where that's where that
a lot of situations where people are trying to break somebody but actually they're they're hoping against hope that the man won't break because really what they want to happen
mean all these a lot of these people go to matt's for example why are they going to matt's or why are they talking to him why is he so important
that they want to show and to share as much uh vitriol out of
yeah i mean there's uh there's always a constant shifting of the guard with all of this
the usual bankers we had the politicians we had the priests we had everybody who was in a position of authority
kind of certainty to people proven to be more than flawed and treacherous in some in in some
you know a mark of i guess a an example of hope in the world so
talking we did a film together called the guard and when we wrapped that film the last day of shooting after the last day
the notion of how difficult it must be for a good man to be a priest at a time when the catholic church is under so much fire and uh people's attitudes towards priests so they are changing and there was a lot of pedophilia and abuse being reported and coverup so that must be difficult to be in this serious a man who is serious about his faith and he said well
do it and so i said yeah so that's what attracted me to it he wrote it
i thought little bits and pieces and that's where we went so it was fantastic to go
a very profound script and um it dealt with questions in a very fearless kind of a way um which was more important
you know he he he can write funny dialogue but he he also writes very tender dialogue
um needed to be at the very center of the film that its that's they were incredibly moving um so yeah it was uh it was fantastic through you know he he he sent
as i say it was fantastic that it got made in the end and i feel we've we've made the film we wanted to
um i think it did yeah i mean i think i felt i knew him from the
between about seven and ten or eleven uh who was an extraordinarily good man and very inspirational to a number of
yeah and i think i think when i look back at it now possibly he was a big inspiration
good people you know uh over the years so i i suppose i delved into things i believed in as a child
um to find you know there's a clarity there's a very clear faith in
came in i think that's the core of the film and you know it's if the the film is not really about a a village in ireland it's about
and the kind of disillusionment that is quite widespread now all over the world and where people find it difficult to
you know divinity or um people find it difficult to be inspired by by others anymore
and i think it is a brave thing for a man to commit to something as his life's work other people then within the place and it is an interesting situation
um so i mean it was a big decision that john made uh to go on location over there it's not easy to shoot there was a lot of um very bad weather and i think i'm trying to remember i think it was
was it october maybe it was quite late in the year so there were a lot of storms and uh but it's magnificent and it becomes a character in the film i think in a way um so it was fantastic i mean it was
uh i also think that you don't necessarily have to photograph everything that you see in order to remember it people now with iphones uh photograph
cause sometimes you can't go on but you will go on i think excuse me i think that was um partly it and he's
i'm starting a film now in london called suffragette which is about the suffragette movement
engaged with that and carey mulligan and meryl streep and um helena bonham carter and all of and a whole lot of fantastic women are in
chris is one of the world champions of drinking
we come out one night now chris of course is gonna go home with elaine have a glass of wine and go to bed and i'm i'm not gonna do anything too because i'm too old but one thing chris says to me he says look at these kids he says they're all going to some gym someplace to work out he says remember what we used to do back in the old days i mean we would have been blasted half an hour after the curtain went down
and it's true i mean in those days it did seem to be a lot more fun i mean we were a lot crazier no people weren't as worried about
uh and and chris farley and uh you know i've i i knew all those guys sam sam kinison was a an extraordinary genius brilliant
and extremely self destructive uh who had cleaned himself up you know i mean it it was amazing here's sam driving back from vegas and
some guy who was drunk comes across the divider and and hits him in the head on
uh i had a second family i mean i was always
sneaky drinker i'd you know if i was on location or in a hotel someplace maybe i could maybe once in a while get blasted
uh years ago ten years ago twelve years ago and my son cormack who is now a a a a freshman at
and my son cormack who is now a a a a freshman at syracuse and
high at that point but as i'm looking around the room my eyes catch his eyes his eight year old eyes and he was looking at me with that look and that look said what's he gonna do
how how how how bad will it get today how far will he go today
what that was the end of that part of my life because when i looked at that kid
i said i'm not gonna subject him to this stuff so it stopped and uh
and that's one good thing i can say about it all you need to do is have one kid look at you a kid that you love and say please
i i guess it's the best of i'd say it's been my favorite restaurant for twenty five years i
i started really going it a lot in la where my friend gigi delmaestro runs a place and of course wally
friend gigi delmaestro runs the place and of course wally ganzi and bruce bozzi are old friends of mine
one of the things that kept me honest over the years was going to chicago and do working in the theater which is
conversely so to me uh the passion is more important the
god that must have been taken so much guts to play macbeth in front of five hundred
every once in awhile somebody would say give me a daiquiri you know and it'd be ten o clock and it's jammed and you'd say you know something go across the street i'm not making any daiquiris right
so i'm shots and beers and scotch and soda and rye and soda and then of course there will always be without being chauvinistic about it there'll always be some twenty year old twenty five year
and some people are really good at being a construct you know they construct themselves and then they become that person and they're wonderful at it not me
you know i mean i i asked uh when i looked around in this part which is
are there any celebrities up there and she said oh yes she said we have a few stars i said who she said well big bird
but for bar owners when they saw that motor home pulling up and twenty guys pouring
but um i can't tell you how many times we wound up where somebody had to actually drive
um it's amazing how many felonies we've committed on saint patrick's day over the
and that is booze has to be a lot of booze okay and if there's a lot of booze and the right people are there you can have a hell of a party and we always had a great
no you always know you can always tell when you had a great party when the la sherriffs
mosca con mosca it means with flies we had flies for
catch as catch can business i mean i it's from here to there you never know what's gonna happen i don't know what's gonna be
uh i've been very fortunate in my life i've done a lot of interesting things i've done what i wanted to do and i've been able
because that's all they would let me take all of which i woulda had read by the weekend uh these were not all well i talked about incredibly complicated books but they but i had a tremendous appetite for reading given to me by my father
and he knows me carrying ever since chicago he knows me carrying a shopping bag full of
get furious when they say why do you buy all these books all you have to do is give somebody a gift card or something
that the writers are getting more money for the book than they are for that piece of electronic whatever the hell it
and my father uh never changed but reading and writing
i was uh i did a a a picture one night it wasn't actually it was a live telecast some of you may remember this george clooney somehow got warner brothers to agree to put on a live
i remember uh the the british director who's name i can't think of right now
why can't we put it on tape and rehearse and everything anyway we did it live walter cronkite was
cronkite came over to me and he said is your father ed
i said yes he was he says he was an amazing newspaper man a wonderful dude he went on and on about my father knowing my
what do you think about all this what we were doing there that night and i said well my father would have hated it my father loved books and he loved movies and but uh uh you know the whole idea of doing
typewriters on these desks these battered desks and people howling at each other and in that in that
uh ap editorial board and when the elevator doors opened and i could
can understand the value of which is to appreciate
word the written word the thought behind the word and the
it's more true now and at at the age of seventy three than it ever was before but it's all about
named chris sweeney who's still alive and uh in those days in nineteen fifty two or fifty three if you were a catholic high school lay teacher in
and he decided that i should play the king macbeth i was
dramatic moment that they could possibly imagine was jackie robinson turning a double
in any case uh my friends in the business always say when i tell this story my god what guts what guts to do shakespeare to do macbeth
in front of a group of uh catholic high school boys in brooklyn in nineteen fifty three you were a brave brave man boy
years later talking to chris sweeney the guy who ran that club um and started us all off the kid's name was marius panzarella beautiful italian boy he was thirteen or fourteen he had a wonderful husky voice and he was a hell of a lady
a just a just a real tough guy you know despite bad beginnings
this and uh when i showed up to audition wearing my football zipper
corps for uh almost four years and needless to say there wasn't much traumatic
off of broadway and at the age of twenty eight
long story short i mean i was working i was driving a cab i was driving truck i can't remember i maybe uh uh i always had a
and wrote this review and in those in those days everybody read the times everybody read the times and especially the
except of course i didn't read the times you know i read the daily news
maybe the post but anyway i came in we'd we'd do the shows on the weekends thursday
and it was a big cast everybody was distinctly cold to me i uh which was unusual i mean none of us were making any money uh i mean any money no
eventually it became obvious to me that a review had been written in new york times in which i was
nobody else in the play was and uh well that's a it sounds great but believe me when you gotta do another month or six weeks with a bunch of actors who are
or when uh you know i wasn't even and i and i was never a even a much of a believer in myself in fact
so i called somebody who had been from time to time my agent
is that the producers or one of their representatives has to interview every equity member who wants to
and looking at somebody handed me a bunch of the pages and there were four or five different excerpts one of which
to be part of reshooting like three episodes but um i have some very good friends here at at the hallmark channel and um they
been around now it's our starting our third season so i'm enjoying it i love going up to vancouver
uh this fictional town of cedar cove out of the environs of vancouver british
cause those are the best months up there it's so gorgeous i highly recommend it if you've never been come on
interesting material very different i mean there were no video games and stuff like that they were arcade game
um but i think it uh it was very uh groundbreaking and it was a pioneering effort and it was
well we don't know if this is really gonna work but they're giving it a try and um i think what's wonderful about
it has resonated all the way to this time now and here we are in the twenty first
living you know the age of information uh computers um certainly the video game world which is so sophisticated now compared to the arcade games that we
i wanna think that uh maybe tron the tron films kind of uh influenced that i mean that's first i've heard of that but um i don't hang out in too many bars and play
games but i think there's a kind of maybe a little bit of nostalgia to
yeah but maybe to go out and do it and share the
in the uh in that episode so um pretty interesting let's we'll put that off for a couple season
so uh no what's it like i it's just uh you know it's it's the common question here for me
it's a nice mix the two of us cause that's mainly who i work with now in this initial part uh
and and and everybody it's so great to like a new cast i'm kinda still there but this whole new cast has come in and it's kinda great to to have these new energies and these new people
it's certainly different uh doing the animated series because
create the character you gotta bring him to a voice and uh i've been saying this all day um trying to find
tron's voice that was the journey that i with charlie bean our director had to do and
um as unrelenting as um you will see that tron is with beck charlie was with me so i was
and he was tron uh the director i mean he was a harsh taskmaster and uh
and uh he would keep pushing me get me angrier and angrier to get that really ravaged uh
of he caught elijah even the timber of his voice he caught him so wonderfully and he's a voice actor but no i think um
got him some scripts and we were trying him out for
much that i was hired to do the screen test with all the young prospective hopefuls
and uh this was well before we shot we actually shot movies like november before the april that
uh i remember at that time thinking you know this is uh they hired me to do this i got the role of alan
for the final film and it was actually a different scene by then anyway but so here we now with tron: uprising
um they're going elijah wood we're not sure he's got a very certain timbre to his voice we want to see how that sounds i'm hearing
here i am auditioning for um the voice of tron now
so it was kind of interesting and i think it worked out great um but yeah he was down i think doing the hobbit through a lot of this i mean we did shot all this we did all this all this last year and he would come back and do stuff over again we'd
tweak this they'd do some rewriting when they were doing the animation i never really got to see much of the animation so maybe a scene here and there
and i love how they've kept true to the uh legacy world and then added some more aspects argon
like uh i do like it i it's it i first looked at it went wow
think uh there's a little anime influence there i think the uh what's her name's character who plays the sort of bad
time but there was always rumors uh i know steven could probably answer that
initially but we weren't into that sequel stuff yet you know it was die hard most things have kinda kick started that certainly star wars but that was always meant to be a trilogy we always knew that
so yeah that the surprise that uh there was gonna be anything but then i did some of the video games i i latched onto this character of tron and i wasn't gonna let go and i wasn't gonna let anybody
then we all did but i embodied him at first so you know i said no
um after the uh footage had been shown at comic con that went viral just went
then i got the call from sean bailey and joe kosinski personally to ask me would i would i want to be
i know of course and i i but i was very touched that they would call personally instead of like a an agent
so uh it was good but i think uh uh in this one
i know lance henriksen now lance i've always said lance
and lance is terrific and you know we're the two older guys in this thing well
a little early while he was doing his just to make sure i wasn't
know where the i love all the way to the shot um when he reveals himself
just i uh i in saying it uh you know i didn't see it as an until
and uh i just i had no idea what to envision and what did he look like that he was disfigured but
that it's that it's uh pleasantly um you know you could sit there and go oh my god i hope this turns out alright you know uh i have so little i had the least to do with it those poor guys that charlie and aaron and mike all these guys that are in the booth that i would just show up once every few weeks or whatever it was uh
we all grew up with cartoons this to me is not a cartoon it's an animated feature it's like for lack
uh it's an animated series and it's a very logical i think extension or aspect of this whole tron mythology
after all based in the whole thing about tron was in the beginning this cg
turn out and i always add this little story that in nineteen eighty two we were exempted from the oscars in the animation
project uh first of all we had nothing to relate to i mean so far as uh something like this project before that i mean animation matte paintings all those great things and we had all those people we were at the great studio that you know really was the the the epicenter of animation so um but while doing the project we did have a slight sense of uh sort of stepping out into the unknown um i think harrison ellenshaw our effects
uh would tell you richard taylor these guys and uh steven lisberger the creator of it all we were starting something we had that very well um
could have failed very well could have just uh not had any impact at all and that it was kind of exciting in itself you don't get to do that very often otherwise
itself was pretty much you know film acting the way we do it only that you had to wait tremendous amounts of time in between setups because of the lighting had to be so specific
um you know the all the the it was a slower process than normally shooting and i had really come off of television more and i was used to a much
so um but i enjoyed it i mean we played video games arcade games excuse me they were
um and ran around in our our tights and stuff like that
uh the you know jeff was listening to talking heads on his tape recorder on his belt and um uh i was roping
to um doing what we do like you would do in a normal job just waiting in between and then then doing the intense scenes and then leaving or i was throwing frisbees with my coach uh sam shot that's a fun name for a guy throwing
meaning years it was always uh people would come up to me and go you know um especially when i started after babylon i started babylon five and i was going to doing sci fi conventions that's when i really saw the fans and so many people came up and like i gotta tell you something that uh you know i was very much influenced by this movie you did tron and i'd start hearing tron tron tron and i realized there was
a groundswell of people that um that were very influenced by the film uh they grew up with it it was something that you know
something with the sophistication and the cinematic quality that you have today i think tron
you notice right now uh sci fi television is very different um i'm a bit critical of it um uh it's kind of all over the place we were specifically in outer space for the most part in the nineties was outer space
uh firefly or it was uh uh farscape babylon five but the the the behemoth as you say was star trek and that was the one that set the bar for all others and i'm very proud to say that we were the little space station that could and we kinda whooped its ass um i take take avery books in ds nine i was constantly saying come on brother bring it cause
and uh so it was quite a phenomena but that show because i had done tron i actually was very well aware of the uh the green screen process or blue screen black screen whatever you
the green screen process or blue screen black screen whatever you want to use and uh i already knew how to deal with something uh to imagine that that little piece of cross tape over there as a um a narn battleship or a uh you know a uh a
i was just known as conrad but he had been this general i pardon me it wasn't colonel i got brought myself down in rank uh it was this general and uh
um uh apocalypse now he kinda that's his oh it was kind of was the joseph conrad story of kurtz who'd kind of um uh he's gone off he's really wigged out and uh i actually did that for about a year off and on they
finally saw it i mean the the the voice work i got to do all kinds of just
and um finally saw it everybody said wow this is incredible you know i've got my my sons all have the game and everything and uh so um i really i've been doing mostly that i've been doing tron uprising the animated series and
well let's face it i mean nowadays it's uh come and see the the motion picture based on the hit video game
wow i mean what a concept that was i mean that was a change around
um so it kind of tells you that this has been a game changer all uh uh the industry recognizes now um i mean what we have
uh of a home video where you're going to have uh multitudinal endings and you'll be able to pick your ending or uh change in plot or something like that we'll be shooting all kinds of versions
and um a couple of the video game tron two point oh and uh what else have i done i've got two more games um
you start to wonder well what am i gonna teach them what what do i want them to know and and
i wanna pass on to my child and that really got me thinking about my my faith because it
took the gospel message from me and it applied it personally to me so i could finally see myself
i really am a sinner that i am not this great wonderful perfect person that i always thought that i was
early twenties i realized that i had a very unhealthy relationship with
when i became a woman of faith and decided that this was the most important thing in my life i finally
what i was eating or how i was treating my body or the amount of exercise i did or didn't do and therefore i never thought about asking god to help me
maybe that's just a silly problem to be asking god about but when i realized that i was abusing my own body um with
if i'm calling myself a christian and a woman that's walking in god's ways then i'm not treating
exercising what my routine was and as i was talking
to so many women the conversations got very deep because i had to explain to them that you know really
wasn't only about food choices and only about exercising but much
or or bulimia but even the overeating of food um
it was really god that did a change in me and a change in my mindset that i had to continually renew my mind
need to know the word of god and we need to know the characteristics of god and we need to know how god views
god's love would never ever change dependent upon what number is on the scale it's not how his love works but we are to honor our bodies because our bodies are
totally i never dreamed of being back on the show and doing it it's even
because it was so it was such a special eight years of my life and people that have been my friend since i was ten years old and
it it was the first time i'd been back on the warner brothers lot in a in many many years and
you all the memories come back and when i pulled up it just felt so emotional
my entire childhood was brought back to me just by smelling the soundstage and then i got to go
in my life i remember actually watching debbie matenapoulos the very
to myself wow that's so intimidating she's so brave to be on there with barbara walters and i couldn't imagine talking about the things that she's talking about and politics
and of course i grew up on a set and i'm in entertainment and i don't think i ever had politics on the brain i didn't really grow up in a political family either
so there's two things i guest cohosted a handful of times and again wasn't on the radar that they were even looking for to have me as a permanent cohost so it was much easier going in as a guest cohost i was like
so we'd like you to be permanent then i felt like oh i you know this is like a real thing now and so it put a little bit more pressure on okay you know what if i say something what if i don't say something
that's a great question um i think there's so many facets to me and depending on what you're a fan of of what i've done i think people have very different viewpoints of me cause if you're like oh i grew up watching full house or fuller house like this is one kind of fan some people appreciate me for being on the view and um
miss goody two shoes and miss perfect and i'm thinking to myself i'm not trying to be and i'm certainly not but um but maybe because i i
why i know it's everything because i've reached in uh dreams and accomplished things that weren't even on my bucket list so i i'm like that's
to this path because there are so many things that have happened in my life that i couldn't
so important to me and you know i give all credit to god for everything because i'm he's given me all my talents all my abilities and i can utilize them to um to the best of my ability and what i choose to do is to glorify him in that way and i don't wanna ever stop doing that because i then that becomes
what is this all about and yet there was something i
said if anyone wants to receive christ to say the sinner's prayer with me so at that time i thought i wanted jesus christ to be the lord of my life and my savior so i prayed that sinner's prayer
working on the show and traveling on the weekends to do appearances and talk shows and radio shows for publicity my church life certainly went on the back
think so highly of myself in the sense that i was a good person that i thought if the worst thing i'm doing is being intimate with my boyfriend before i
that's just not that bad compared to what so many other people
character that stood out to me pastor bruce barnes because in the at the beginning of the book the rapture has occurred and christ has taken all of his people the left the rest of have been left
and in the book bruce barns knew exactly why he'd been left behind and that's because
living my life the way i wanted to and just using his forgiveness as a license to do
and it really woke me up and i it was that moment where i thought i need to know what the bible actually says i need to start knowing how do i know that i'm gonna go to heaven how do i know that i'm not gonna be left
cause i can't simply i can't just believe in jesus but then do whatever i want living my life however i think is right
understand why jesus died i understand truly that i'm a
and i realized my offense before a holy holy god
and i just i would got down on my knees and i just prayed and i said lord i don't ever wanna forget this moment i don't wanna ever forget this understanding and i just pray that lord you will uh grow this within me so that i can become the woman you want me to become and i just wanna live my life
voice on the show i've got to share on some subjects biblically which has been awesome and even
of being in the entertainment industry and still standing on
if you wanted to party i also it we it's really fun when there's um like the halloween episode the the set was just decorated so amazing everything was just so over the top you know it was like party city just
let's see yeah just uh uh went to a halloween house party and dressed up as a
and this is something unbeknownst to caroline that that um that her mother
that um that her mother keeps from her in in in i think attempt to protect her but it's really just driving them farther apart
where caroline and damon's relationship is going to go um i think that she's starting to realize that something's different about him she you know she doesn't know that he's a vampire
guy and girl not getting along in the relationship there's something different in which you know considering that he's manipulating her mind every chance he gets you know she's not crazy so she's just trying to figure out you know and remind herself that she's not crazy that there is
and ian somerhalder is just a blast to work with so whenever we have those scenes we we usually get a couple good laughs out of them um before we start focusing in
um but yeah you know any excuse to stare deeply into his eyes is a
friend um actually took a vampire class as an uh extracurricular class at her school and um and what i found most interesting is that there are groups of people out there that feel
are vampires and so and one of the things they offered like if you would like to donate blood you know after you've been tested
originated way back or the thought of the vampire originated in romania way back in the day it's when it it gets so cold outside and when your body when the dead gets so cold there's sometimes happens where something happens where your body jerks up and so they'd see the
the dead move so then it kind of as if they were still alive and then they were vampires i guess
lot of friends now that are taking it and they and i've answered like questions for them about the show and stuff but but yeah it's really and and she legitimately got to go and interview a vampire you
like a group of people that that practice vampirism and so
to say that we will see both gentlemen try to one up
but caroline is very stuck on who she wants to be with caroline wants
see it as a love triangle and it's definitely painted out to be a love triangle but from caroline's perspected perspective it is very much
in the first season you know sitting there across from bonnie saying why don't the boys ever choose me like i try so hard
it just happens to be the mass murdering you know evil boy who is making an army of murderers um
maybe not the ideal uh boy to have chasing after her but um so i i think it's pretty funny but uh but i can see why the viewers excited
cause it just shows the softer side of clause and um and i mean the boy's got an accent let's be honest
caroline and stefan had such a great friendship between season two so i think that she really has
the reasons in which you know elena has fallen for him and she sees that he can protect her and bring a good side of her out and damon hasn't always been the nice guy and he hasn't always done the right thing
and caroline has become very protective of her friends and and um so yeah i think that she just
true love so i think ultimately it would be kind of terrifying for
um a character even though she's become very strong but a character still as vulnerable as caroline to to open her heart to a character like stefan in which he's already so emotionally attached to elena
um i we
knew um what to expect for the finale of season six so we knew that um certain characters were departing the series and
so we were i think a lot more emotionally prepared than uh the fans and viewers of the show um but you know six years in we've all worked together um so many hours and and done so many incredible things together that uh it's it's exciting to see people move on to new ventures and um and i think it's a really beautiful time for the
play caroline i i don't obviously i find certain days very challenging it was a long year um the season with caroline's mother passing away in a very very sad way and a very very human way um from cancer and so that was definitely hard to come to work every day and knowing um what you know what was going on in the storylines and i just thought it was so beautifully and tragically
have i learned any lessons from caroline um that it's okay
to be selfish um as long as you recognize the person that you wanna be and work every day to be a better person and and so i think caroline was a very you know faulted
and um but she grew into herself and that you know you have to forgive yourself and you know and and so that's i really love that about the character
you know not even just as a cast but as you know our crew we've had a lot of crew members with us since season one so um you know it's a family at the end of the day i call it the traveling circus that doesn't travel anywhere and um so it's very sentimental um again like no one actually died so you know we're all gonna see each other plenty and we're all engrained in each other's lives you know at this point whether we like it or not and and um luckily we do
and so and it was very very sentimental but i'm excited um to see what happens
i love uh that the characters of caroline and stefan have had a long as julie plec says
not like each other at all we've seen them become friends and then we've seen them now become more than friends and i think that um
and i love when two characters on a television series you get to see them you know grow and and learn to love each other over a long period of time and you know and so there's so many layers to their
it you know things about my life have come out um and my feeling always was well wait a second then if it's gonna be out then we're gonna do
no okay that's not okay with me so if it's gonna be out that's not the way i want it out so if we're gonna say i'm in i've been in a mental hospital
once we started doing the show we opened the show in berkeley and we were there for months and months and months and so i you know
and he was a joyous spirit and i was really i'm really grateful that i got to have the relationship that we ended up
right when i you know sort of found him in a
show uh i mean in the book right about uh we had gotten him a stripper right
great relationship it all the pictures in the house were of me you know so i got to be the
yeah it was nice uh i have two half sisters and so i we were all together in san francisco and we all together went to
the thing is when i was put my mother put me on stage when i was thirteen i
watched what show business did to both my parents which
them up celebrate them and then at about forty for my mom and earlier for my
what i'd say about it if i was is is if i'd known that by donning the metal bikini when i was twenty
uh uh an invisible contract to stay looking the exact same
i'm schitt's i've been on schitt's now they're making even more stuff
and there is a sex doll they say it's a sex doll but it's made out of some
you know the the thing is if my life wasn't funny it would just be true and that's
uh but my the alchemy that i have been able to over time
crap into gold that uh you know if you can laugh at that if you can claim something it has far less power over you
there's certain things that by claiming them i own them and they don't own me it's like i have problems but problems don't have
it's got the worst rap that you could possibly have it's just
i mean and hollywood has more than contributed to that it was in the
it's been great and i wish i'd done it earlier and i did not because of you know the
and because at that i do not wanna make anyone uncomfortable except myself i
um it started when i was about fourteen i found a scrapbook that a fan had sent my
and about you know my mother being dumped and then the pictures of the babies and i mean the
um but you know over time it evolved into something else i became friends
elizabeth taylor in fact i actually called her to tell him he passed and um and she
uh go so you've all woken up with dead people then
i wish i could remember the stories from the old days but those were what the old days were
i went on uh one of my first dates with my first husband paul there
uh you know all the waiters that wore shorts and no top and
roller skating around in that thing at the front where you had to
and the cocaine parties in the basement so i say that now from now on i'm only gonna play places where i did drugs or dated before so it'll be a
if it meant anything that would make anyone else that i wrote about uncomfortable i would take out i don't wanna
you know what that was and if they didn't like it it made them uncomfortable i'd take
of some really nice connections that i made with people who have had similar
fled the building and actually almost had kinda like a fist fight with another audience member
didn't think he was acting well but it turned out that he was uh doing the harder
didn't do minneapolis but you know it's sort of like if you can make it
and i but i mean you know i'm doing another book now and really part of it will be
uh laurence olivier didn't act like joanne she was sort of frustrated
because you know there's a scene where he's supposed to strangle her and he wouldn't apply any pressure you know and she's a much
i don't know i mean i i don't know that i was ever that great at it but anything's
if i could do that really truly do that i would be blessed and when i can do that which i sometimes can blessed um
i i and i'm i would i would maybe like to write another thing about
and there's actually a photograph that i was in the la times or
it did something for me that i couldn't do for myself whatever that
done anything i stole it from medicine cabinets we we invented this
on amazing irresistible so he'd come around more
no it it you know things about my live have come out
always was well wait a second then if it's gonna be out then we're gonna do my
right when i'd you know sort of found him you know
great relationship if all the pictures in the house were of me you know so i got to be the
and so i we were all together in san francisco and we all together went to
when i was put my mother put me on stage when i was thirteen i had
what show business did to both my parents which was
them up celebrate them and then at about forty for my mom and earlier for my dad
uh invisible contract to stay looking the exact same way for the next thirty to
uh but my the alchemy that i have been able to over time
i own them and they don't own me it's like i have problems but problems don't have
it's got the worst rap that you could possibly have it's just
i mean and hollywood has more than contributed to that it was in the
and because if that i do not wanna make anyone uncomfortable except myself i really enjoy being uncomfortable myself
my ex uh that billie's father that that probably
on my daugher is i am one of those mothers that causes her daughter to roll
she would never if she ever was a writer would never write autobiographic
um it started when i was about fourteen i found a scrapbook that a fan had sent
about you know my mother being dumped and then the pictures of the babies and i mean
um but you know over time it evolved into something else i became friends with elizabeth taylor in fact i actually called her to tell him he
into it i mean when i i come out i basically go with the worst
feels good i mean my parents still live here so i i come back um i'd like to come back
um i'm around several times throughout the year and it always feels good it's home you know it's
as much as we can i'm always like looking up baby friendly things to do in you know wherever we are and uh he's been to zoos and aquariums and um you know we we try
and hitting up those those that standard i want him to have childhood normalcy i know
you know and i think that's the important thing we take them down to the pools at at the hotels and let them splash around cause you know a kid would do that they would
downstairs please take me mom so we try to do those things to keep his
definitely uh my husband and i have have future plans for an rv for sure and we're gonna be taking
um i love i love long hair and i love it on other people and i loved it on me
like this is just ridiculous like what can i do in my life to kinda streamline some things and make things a little bit easier and that was that was one
now give us a beach somewhere a lake uh it's where where
i love that um um you know obviously into like sporting goods dick's sporting goods has a
kicking off a five hundred thousand dollar donation that they're gonna be making to different uh girl's sports programs um throughout the us
donating a hundred thousand dollars to the girls' athletic programs here so um that's that's big that's huge like we got to announce it to the girls out there
i can see the wheels turning and you guys thinking of all the things that you know you need you know um different equipments and
definitely was you know a lot better than i thought it would be just because i mean it's
it was just the the song from the show you know i mean it was just kind of a memento for people to have something to have out there while i was touring with the american
just in listening to it it was one that everybody agreed on and everybody liked so it was really
things that kinda work different on the album so if i had a lot of this type of song i definitely wanted to look for something that was more
during the show and uh so it was just kinda like alright well we'll just put this one on there and you know but um i mean it it's a great song you know i think martina
you know she's first and foremost and i just
group that went in to try out so had to wait in the stadium for i'd say
there's not gonna let me through jeez you know but um i mean everything
be like hmm you know ooh i sing rock music i can go try out for american idol you know so i i think we all kind of
two to three thousand i think in front of us so i've never sang in front of like ten thousand people before
oh yeah and singing that that's about the only thing i don't think i've really done
i i knew i had to go to school and go to college and and get a degree in something and
hold a but she can hold a tune she's got a a pretty nice voice but she lacked the desire to
think about everybody's voice or style or music that
you know this kinda music or this person or whatever so uh i've definitely
would say roy orbison definitely i love him and his voice and his wife and everything i
play pretty cool meeting me sometimes a lot of people like when i touch and hug and sometimes they'll get a little rough
dumb i mean just kind of random things that people like to throw things uh on when i'm on stage not bad they'll throw care bears and and stuff
album and um faith hill and course rascal flatts and lonestar
oh i got lunch with these people like i'm gonna run by these people and say hi so he's been super busy like just making the rounds saying hello to everybody
i know the area that we have um our like
because once i clock the in laws like it's over i suddenly become really self conscious and i'm like oh my gosh like they're looking at
book or you know anything to follow like you just kind of have to figure things out as you go but um we've been uh really lucky just to be blessed with a baby that can kind of go with the flow
he's uh he's kinda used to it i don't know if you ever really get used to it but uh he does he does as well as better than better
people enjoy seeing isaiah running around too because it's kinda like aw they miss their kids and um you know we we definitely have lots of family that comes to different different shows as we go through cause everybody's got family
there we we started working with a different like tour designer and um he uh he just had some incredible ideas i'm like oh my gosh that all sounds great you know and then once we started getting into like order of things i'd to kinda start getting
i don't know anything about like tour lighting or any stuff or any anything like that so that was definitely more let the
um but it's it's a collaborative effort and it's a lot of fun to put together something like this so we definitely wanted to make sure that everybody just had a great could have a
i'm lucky in that department um i have friends that you know are like i gotta go do my warmups like they spend an hour warming up and i've i've never really had to do that i'm just like i don't know it's just this is what i love to do i'm just gonna go have fun with it
i've unless i'm sick um which which does happen but i i feel like i'm also like loud so i can kinda like power through it
something like that but there were no guarantees and so i came on uh at the end of season three as a
um i i kind of did it an episode at a time uh the the cast and the crew are so supportive
teams i've worked with and i think it's probably the most generous warm set i've
see how you react to it and they might ask for your input a little bit but ultimately shonda kind of has the final word and luckily shonda has the final word because she's done a fantastic job for five seasons yeah we're at the read through and sometimes there are gasps
you get to develop your empathy for another human being and and kind of fill them out in the most uh
uh compassionate where you can you try and look at this person that's totally different from you and
and you try and look at this person that's totally different from you and imagine how they could have ended up this way and it and if you had been born into their life and had lived their situation uh how how you
for this role that i'm doing now because some of it is really technical and it's very sensitive i wanted to be very uh authentic and true to it and not offend anyone and and be sensitive about about what i
and so i was working really closely with both the medical staff on the show and also um some former addicts who who are now recovered and um and who are
addiction awareness and counseling and and so i was working really closely with with some people who had uh direct
that i helped deliver was actually my my little sister uh was a uh she was actually a
and she had opted for a home birth with a midwife and so i was the person who was kind of there with her and experiencing this whole
and me and the midwife and my mother and
it was this young woman and through the experience of watching her give birth
thirty four or fourteen to i don't know which demographic mm i
yes to date this is i think yeah the highest profile definitely the the the biggest um publicity machine i've ever been a part of a lot of the work that i'd done before was in uh was out of canada and it was just not the same kind of
juggernaut that that you get in the states and so it's it's been kind of a whole learning curve uh but it's been fun
all of those presuppositions uh it's it's not exactly it's not based on lewis
it's a hundred and fifty years later um a lot of the same kind of themes and
characters are in this version but they've all kind of been uh adjusted and messed with and and uh reinterpreted and so yes my character shares the name alice but
uh kidnaps humans from our world and brings them into wonderland and brings them to a massive casino where they're all hooked up to these tables where everyone wins all the time and and so these kind of positive emotions like you know passion and lust and excitement and are kind of drained out of humans and they call humans oysters uh and and and these tinctures that they get from humans are used to kind of pacify the masses
call sheet and you see her name next to yours and you realize that you really have many many people
um i shot i shot uh the movie with mel first and that was directed by martin
who's also great he did casino royale and he does a lot of fantastic action movies and so we did that in boston in november and then we shot alice
her uh labor coach and it was a really fantastic experience and so i'd gotten really interested in midwifery she had done it at home with a midwife
uh and so i read this book by a woman named ina may gaskin who uh is kind of a pioneer of midwifery and
place called the farm in tennessee where she trained people to be midwives and had been practicing midwifery for years and so in between doing missing and moving to la i kind of went into
and and then ended up coming out to la and starting to get an agent and also assisting a midwife for a while until
of years to be able to give birth very well our whole bodies are structured to do this thing very well
occasionally there are complications but that's different from something you would normally do in a hospital which has to do with disease and pathology right and so so i think as women are learning more about their bodies uh and learning more about what they want they're starting to go oh i'm being pregnant and and having a baby doesn't mean i'm ill
it means that i'm doing something that is totally natural so why would i be in a in a medical facility to do that that said thank god we have medical facilities because sometimes there are emergencies and and you need to have medical staff to deal with them
natural birth is a really fantastic option that's really empowering for women and i i mean with actresses i suppose lots of actors and actresses spend a lot of time sitting around
so maybe maybe that's i don't know why but i think women in general are starting to become a lot more interested in
idea that pregnancy and birth is something beautiful and empowering and natural as opposed as to something that they need
birth especially natural birth is kind of unpredictable so if you're during doing like a two day labor or a twenty six hour labor your agent can't get you on
from the very i mean he's such a central part of amelia's life he's such a core
he'll in every season in every episode for the rest of the show he's gonna
uh at some point i no one will ever fill that void that is always going to be mcdreamy but um but the show is incredible it has such a life i think shonda
a genius storyteller and she creates these incredible multidimensional characters that you
really start to develop relationships with and um and so there's this whole clutch of friends
are continuing and grieving and coming together and helping each other um get through this and and they're falling in love
so i don't know if there's ever like a firm happily ever after there's always kind of this wild ride um
first of all she's a genius uh and she channels something from above um but i
to the industry in general and to the world in general that there are stories that we want to hear that weren't being
you know uh stories about uh that represent you know the world as it actually
all different types of walks of life and i and i think we were kind of in a situation where a lot of television was this kind of
mirroring us back to ourselves and it makes us feel very passionate we're suddenly like yes those are my friends those that's my family i wanna be a part of this conversation and so i think she's i think she just showed us what we were
you know love actually they're in the airport and it's all these like big huge moments but hospitals too i mean people are being born people are dying people
the one thing though that we often laugh about is that i think if we had been on call for the number of hours that we are often on call
there's a mystery built into it that we find out through the film that somebody in the village is a werewolf and has this double identity and everybody starts suspecting each other and we don't know who it is as the stakes keep getting higher and higher and more and more secrets and lies are unraveled you know we're just hopefully on the edge of our seats like trying to figure out what's the answer to this mystery and can we solve it before someone
there's a mystery built into it that we find out through the film that somebody in the
is a werewolf and has this double identity and everybody starts suspecting
the day our movie starts we've we're with um our lead character which is valerie and
true love have just found out that her parents want her to marry somebody else so they are plotting like maybe they're gonna run away and leave right at the moment when they could be leaving this town they find out that they're
for the first time in twenty years the wolf has killed a human that sets off a whole chain of events where we start to discover what's really going on in this town what is a
in many countries all around the world people hear this story and a lot of times we've heard it in a sanitized version because a lot of people now take fairy tales okay let's make it like clean it all up and take out the messy bits and just make it a tale like don't talk to strangers like do what mommy says that's not the point of fairy tales they do go into the darker elements and that's why they stuck with us and made us
and help us through different parts of our life actually
um learning about something maybe when you're five red riding hood means one thing to you when you're seven you start understanding on a different level and even when you're a teenager you respond to it on a
in the world people hear this story and a lot of times we've heard it in a sanitized
when i thought about red riding hood i mean first of all the way amanda
is straight out of a fairytale she's got the most amazing eyes that just
so like she is otherworldly almost and i think that just i felt like her emotion
brand new i guess it's almost his first movie um and he's also just got a lot of heart even though he is the choice of the parents
you keep thinking i thought when i read the script oh my god he's he's pretty cool maybe he's the right person to be with i was getting
and you know how has this person been hiding for twenty years how can we not figure it out what are the clues
including valerie are trying to figure this out and then the outsider comes in gary oldman's character with his team of people and they're trying to really get to the bottom of this find out who's
of the wolf was was one of the key elements in this movie and one thing that we really labored over a bit because this is a creature that is absolutely mysterious we don't know if it's a male or a female we have this beast come in we don't know the powers of the beast it's a legend it
have any kind of powers so we didn't want to like give it all away at the beginning
of this creature you wanted to see it do part of the attack and then can it can it kill more is it more powerful than that so it's like a slow reveal of what
she was a copilot you know helping us but i did have a little apprehension about taking on the project which deals with such a heavy subject that you wanna be respectful of it but we also
fun in a way to show that even if your best friend is having a tough day you can come in and lift them back up with a joke
well uh my dad had cancer and every day he would crack these wicked jokes and i thought
i thought that's the kinda thing we need to do where the people that are involved are still able to be funny and have a great sense of humor and so i think that that's the
well i was lucky that she'd actually read the script before i even knew about it so she already
fearless actress i mean she will dive into anything a hundred
sick and i knew that tony would do that cause i mean look at her body of work it's incredible and then when she came on okay could we get dr
you know i've loved dominic cooper's work for a long time i've his
stubble and all kinds of things and i just thought he would be so interesting in this movie and like this rock and roller that's turned into a pretty cool dad and you know again we kind of had to rewrite a little bit to lure him in and then
and you know everything and i just love him and he's very soulful
girl that's doesn't want to fit in really but everybody else wants
uh dicaprio's company they had the idea of like taking the putting the werewolf back in it which was in the old version of it and that added this whole layer of murder
to the story which i thought was intriguing that someone you know has a dark side someone has a secret you know is a murderer and you know in the middle
sisters killed and so her world is turned upside down and that just kind of drew me in
yeah i mean a novel like um twilight of course had readers all over the world that knew every single detail but this
you know is a very short little story and there's all kinds of versions of it so there was not like one
this so there was more room i think for the writer's imagination for my imagination the actor's imagination to really take
um you know i i love shiloh i met him you know in the twilight audition process and he was one of like the top four choices like bachelor number one two three and four and of course rob
um so i'd been watching shiloh and then he and i i like him and you know i saw him at a party and he goes i should come in for red riding hood and we didn't even know if it was gonna happen or not
girl my friend nicky who was just going through all these kinda crazy troubles and so what i just did with nicky is i just tried to listen to her okay what
through you know what do you have to do how is it like and i was around all of her friends i'd come over and have some
for red riding hood and we didn't know if it was gonna happen or not and i said okay you can come over to my garage and
support their own heads i'm like well you know what's he gonna do what does he now you know and like well he
i get videos and updates and i just love sitting there and watching them he's just so he's
no breastfeeding and no you know i can i can i can just hold him and it's nice
kind of had a had a separate thing going you know we didn't actually have any any baby involvement but we got to we got to watch chris rock and the other guys um
you know the the book was more of a more of like a manual and so they kinda decided to show
the little miss little miss perfect pregnancy with brooklyn decker and and and she has
and at the end they were they were having beers after the after the food truck night so
sort of yeah yeah sort of i think i said that before she um yeah i know they i was kinda
right i i took her to well i took her out to to dinner first okay she she left that
the clermont lounge i thought it was just a dive bar we go down there and well it turns out there's
for karaoke a well we had like little earbuds in our ear and and i didn't realize this was gonna happen i thought i was gonna
in order to kind of make it have more of an impact and kind of like wrap it up within
kind of have a little bit more fireworks you know what i mean a little bit more sparks i think they could
yeah i mean i like i like the both the the relationships you know with serena and blair
it could be the construction worker no i i um they're always awkward a bit but like they get easier as you go along 'cause i'm you know you're friends with them i mean i
i am single at the moment yeah and loving it so i mean i'm twenty two in manhattan and uh i mean i'm focused on the work right now it's 'cause i it's time i gotta be a little bit selfish with time it's a big commitment for
and the australian accent as well gets me so kate beckinsale i used to say rachel
someone told me that and i don't know if that's true i i met them at this at this uh met ball it was like an after party like george clooney's like
oh just the sweetest people ever and i don't think gossip girl got brought up once i don't even think they know what the show is so i don't know
oh i mean god all that goes out the window when you you're shaking hands with maverik you know what i mean it's like okay risky he's done some of the best films in the the past twenty years so
um i think he had a string of a string there that was maybe unfortunate for him but i mean i'm not i don't even know if he pays it much
people in the world i mean if i could work with someone like that that'd be so cool you know
hilarious he's great him and david spade we were at some like event and so that was great david's
well you know that was one of like a hundred takes you know i finally connected but uh yeah no no i dip a little bit from golf so i
yeah it is a true story my my brother in law happens to be tony romo he married my sister and um you know growing up a huge cowboys fan that was uh amazing but
and he just loves competing obviously he's a great golfer so it's hard to tell someone to to reel that back but he did but um one day you know he he used to live out there on the tpc cotton where they played the barn and he's like come on man
play play some holes you know it was like the sun was going down and we get out there and he's like hey man this kid
and uh i mean i mean clearly obviously the kid was a wizard around the greens but you know we played like six holes out there sun's going down you know i'm like man you know you got you got some talent you know best of luck
like maybe you know he's gonna be be great at ut and and whatnot but he had some sponsors' exemptions for the barn and some other things and and clearly he took that route
one of the first times was she was i think she was finishing up college and she was interning with the cowboys and she was doing sports broadcast and she was uh she was really good at it she she's funny she has a great personality and so they kinda let her interview players and it was over summer
and um and she was kinda blown away and then and then uh you know she my she didn't want my parents being massive cowboy she she didn't want them in the house and i'm like we're already here what do you want us to do she's like hide hide in the back hide and then my
for the first date to pick her up yeah which was very nice of him but she it caught caught her off guard so she pushes my parents back in the back and uh i thought that was really
you know after the fact i think i was in new york at the time and uh working on on the show and um yeah so they had their uh they had their movie dinner date and um she had to go back for her last year of college and i think they kinda you know kinda maintained in touch and uh
and then i think the summer after if i remember is when he you know hit her up again it was like hey you know what
like ninety two is like us in starter cowboy jackets and my mom has like a turtleneck you know and we're we're by the fireplace in all cowboys gear so
drawing pictures of deion sanders the whole the whole night so uh
real i mean he definitely like has that iq and and and i and i feel like when they give him a little bit more room to to audible and and um and to exactly read the defenses it's uh he's always excels at that
feeling great so uh he's out there throwing and uh you know we we we uh i'll i'll i'll catch for him sometimes he breaks
it's great but uh no i mean you know it's it's very light he just wants to get out there five ten minutes and throw the ball sometimes if i'm in town and
he's got a zip on it yeah he's got that zip so training camp's coming back soon you know
so he's he's he's waiting you know hear if he gets drafted and uh it's set it's set all in one game on this one field against this silly summer league where they're just trying to you know keep keep loose and um joe's brother john was actually uh
it was a true story and and he started telling joe about this cast of characters that that play these gamesand the other team shows up in a in a bus and they're stretch and they got some you know ex pros with them and it it became like this contentious game the whole neighborhood kind of came out for it and um yeah and the movie the movie's got more it's it's got a lot of great laughs it's it's more about you know the characters and the camaraderie and more like a
what i've never caught before ever and so and so joe was like chase get in there you know and uh alright alright let's go and he goes
you know i i after a few beers i yeah it kinda comes out a little bit you know i i grew up in oklahoma and then and then uh going out to new york for seven years you know and and back
or what he said i mean i don't know but what he said is is that you know i was the most courageous i actually didn't know that i heard him saying that uh
interview and i was like oh that's what that's what it was you know i thought i was i was the most handsome
but at the same time it was it was fun i mean like i i didn't think about it from that point of view like yeah i i i try to find a way of uh
and i felt pressure mostly from the family you know not
or they they were really like you know overbearing at all but i just
do well by them uh when i first when i met rachel robinson the first time i just i i she's a regal woman
she was like a grandmother in in in in that first meeting
it's certain moments along the way you felt i felt that from her and i just wanted
um you know they didn't get this right about about jackie i mean they could they could say it but i felt like if
we don't we don't necessarily know that that moment in the tunnel happened but it had to happen she and it's the fact that she didn't you know say you gotta take that out of the script he never broke down like that he never had a moment where he was
it's important to have that moment in a movie
the whole story like that he gets to that point and then he goes
you know you have to have your space that's what you do i mean you you have space before the scene you have your space after after the
you know cause he's it could be dangerous for you it could be dangerous for me um so
you're given given that protection and i think they provided that so that you could get the most real experience
you know i'm sure i'm sure he did but i felt like the film gave you the right amount of it so that you can enjoy the other parts because one of the things that that rachel robinson said to me is that
remember the the darker moment of that time but the the joy that we found with
and and sometimes that's the irony of life that during the most difficult moments you look back on it and you realize how much you enjoyed it you know how much you can celebrate it
uh you're um you circle those scenes on on the schedule and say
you know that's what it is so i i just looked at it as as you know this is why you play the game
well you learn from his experience i mean there's certain things that you can ask him that are that that you don't
it would be a it would be a foolish thing to not ask him you know certain things about how to do that so i asked him small things at moments and then at other moments i just watched him on set i watched how he uh
i watched um you know the way that he understood how things moved around him
and when you go through like their various writers um and you
um and at the same time he's the superhero but he's not quite a superhero um
that he has this this quality of of being very
you never know quite what he's going to do next so he's always a step ahead of everyone
agenda his own world that he has to protect he has his own lineage that he has to live up to
take orders from iron man he can't just take orders from cap um
the the value in both sides but he's not gonna tell them that you know what his what his what his belief is or what his interest is so he's the kind that you have to figure out
current situations to add to the story um so it makes it topical
for me first off i wanted to be true to to the comic book
that i try to bring to the table that are pulling from
uh tribal history or um tribalism
you know african civilization there are things that i'm always doing
the the decorations here and they they it's it's almost like they're weapons here as well um around
and you see aspects of the ninja as well so i i love that you can look at it in one moment and see one
i don't know if the word is win it was uh it was some weird sign sort of that that it was gonna happen i mean maybe like a year before um
it occurred i you know i've been thinking about the character cause that's what
i got in a conversation with you know the security on set for uh this movie called gods of egypt in australia and we didn't even really talk about black panther at all but he had
then put um the first issue of black panther his original issue from when he was a kid in my trailer and wrote a note and said um you're gonna get this
um a black panther movie or even bring the character to the universe and he i was like okay you know
sorta put it outta my head and then it just sorta became this thing that built in my head that you know maybe this could happen started researching the character more and i was on a set i was on the uh red carpet actually
agent called me and the weird thing about the call is that i didn't even have an international plan on my phone until
and something said this guy said uh you need
he was like yeah i said i'm on the red carpet he was like well they're they you get off the red
so i did the red carpet i got off and got in the car and drove around cause it was a secret conversation and um we they basically were like hey we heard
and they were like you know if it's the character we think you're interested in would you be interested in
there's there's a casting director by the name of sarah finn i think she had a sense of it somehow um but yeah it was definitely one of those eerie um
that i i i saw how i could play a character who is scared to fight
really jumped off the page and then the setting of doing a high school movie i mean i i love high
perhaps the most intimidating confrontation of his life and he has to become a little bit uh
great thing about us working together on this is that we we sort of i think we share a very similar vision for what the movie should be so we're
maybe the scene should accomplish this or accomplish that and we're never too far apart in in what our visions are of
uh both in the scene sometimes but but uh behind the camera because uh he's so cool and collective usually that uh it's tough to break through that exterior so it was nice when i got the chance
well first and foremost we'll start with tracy morgan who uh we're all very grateful is happy and healthy and working again
and uh this was his first uh acting job uh back and uh
he was both very uh grateful to be on set but also very uh excited and almost nervous at first
uh and and getting to be uh caught up in the middle of that storm
is a lot of fun because there's a million funny things that happen both on set and off i often would say i just wish we had a camera rolling on him at all times and we could just cut some of these comments into the movie here and there because he's not
and i was thrilled to be in the movie and both richie and i begged her uh to be in this um yeah i i think is uh a rising star and um and anything she
turn to comedy gold on a set uh a million different sort of uh ways
it's uh do the scenes and uh for me it was very fun to have the dynamic with her
i really just enjoy working with with jason uh bateman and jason sudeikis and and i knew that we'd have a lot of laughs on set and if we could come up with a story
nine years of television so the idea of like coming back with the same characters to me is not uh shocking you know i'm surprised we don't do
think that i liked in the first movie and i'm i'm hoping it's the same uh in the second movie just a little
when these three idiots try and do any kind of crime uh breaking into a house or even breaking out of a house uh uh you know the next morning uh
scenes with these guys in the car uh trying to figure out how to pull off things that they have no capacity uh to pull
and they're two of the funniest guys i've ever met in my life so uh it's it's fun to be around funny
i think you just have to continue the story you know we didn't wanna just do the same story again we didn't wanna do the same story again with
it's uh to me it's always like alright what's next what what could they get into next so um so i i didn't find it daunting to come back to this i think uh i was just happy to check back in with the characters and see what's going on with their lives and then see what kind what fun thing can we get them into
soon start their own company based on this product uh that they came up with um
so he really uh he really is uh sort of taking a big uh risk at the top of the movie and and you're you're seeing him in a situation where clearly he needs that to work out because he has a family now
we're joined by chris pine and christoph waltz in this movie uh they play a father and son uh who have invested in our company and they're they're real one percenter types you know um and this is our characters' opportunity to
sort of achieve the american dream and uh so they get into bed with these
his negotiating tactics have have not improved and what's scary is that he wants to buy and run a business as well you know he's sympathetic to our situation and this is not a man who should run a business i mean
occasionally suggesting uh what kind of crime to do uh so
hank hank himself is in it yeah dean norris the incomparable dean norris
well andy campbell is he's a people pleaser he's he's mr nice guy he just wants everyone to be happy he's he's a a a little too soft on his his uh students he's probably been voted most popular teacher occasionally uh and probably gets off on that you know i think he likes he likes everyone to like him and he hates conflict um and of course uh
the students walk all over him and uh he just takes it and um
yeah yeah no it was it was really fun for me to to be reacting to jillian bell reacting to tracy morgan or kumail nanjiani and uh you know i
and being sort of the eyes of the audience which is that like uh were you seeing what this person's seeing this is nuts
uh so that that's a fun and a different sort of gear for me to operate in and then of course he gets to just go full lunatic
i i love how collective the cast is i love how diverse the cast is um
and you know i think that was important to richie and i uh when we were working on putting the movie together we wanted to get
then you know um when we got jillian bell that character wasn't even written as a women at first and we said what if we write it for jillian bell because she's
you know a super talent and then uh the chance to get tracy morgan back in his first movie uh since the accident and that he was healthy enough to work again and uh to give him that opportunity but then for us to get the opportunity to have him i mean he was very thankful for being there but not as thankful as we were to
i mean just those two guys alone and kumail who i think is just one of the funniest people on the planet i know a lot of people know him from silicon valley but uh i mean he's just everything that comes out of that guy's mouth is hysterical and then even to get like dean norris from breaking bad or like dennis haysbert just to pop in and say a few things i mean the cast really came together in uh one of the best ways
i'm such a big fan of ice cube i always have been and i i started as a fan of him uh in music and of course uh then liked boyz 'n the hood which i
it blew my mind when i saw it and then um you know everything from like three kings to friday i mean i'm just a big fan of ice cube but like i can also i know like all the lyrics to a lot of his songs you wouldn't think it but i do um and so uh it was just a like a surreal moment for me you know i was telling him stories about things that i had done as a kid where i was like listening to his music at the time which i'm sure is odd for him to
great to get to work with him and then really strange for my son who at the time was only three to say uh daddy are you are you working with your friend ice cube is something i never thought i would hear my child
get the scene so i was in this position of trying to find the you know the place where nobody would say
i didn't want to be able myself to be able to compare the words with what he had
and uh i read stuff and maybe i could've
not my father's presence but you know it was like everybody knew what i had in my head
because i wasn't composing any music and i was trying to write
able to be there whilst they were creating something and instrument after instrument uh it was
such a magical time for me and with nigel behind the
just talking to nicola and john benoit for such a long time because i was so scared to start something that i wanted to talk about what it was going to be like and what kind of music and the words were so important for me so
weren't happy we could go on and that was a a great
uh a cd with all the tracks and then just go in the studio and record it i wanted to be there i
judgment he had on on the lyrics mainly for me he was a great
intimidated at first especially once the music was
not finished but there were times when i had to try and put my voice on i was so embarrassed
put my hopes you know i didn't want to hope too much that we was just going to
going to read so it was all a surprise and yes of course it was quite
there would be two of us playing jo so i didn't know when i came in
again not understanding as as it was the same the same with antichrist i i wasn't sure i was getting all the digressions and all the metaphors and
and a lot of the work for me was to understand what what both characters were saying even though jo doesn't really understand what's
he's going on about all the time but still it was interesting for me
so what can i say it's just very scary and
um seeing the film as a whole i have absolutely no
them it's that it's a film about flesh and the
yeah just to know what my limits were in terms of morale
character but i feel that he's putting himself into
well i mean but you have to build the show nobody just gets up there and does it you know people don't realize when you see chris rock and you see all these guys on tv uh that's material that's been tried and true and and worked and reworked and uh you know before chris goes out and does a tour our uh uh special for hbo and all these guys they're on the on the road for six months putting all this together and then what you see is the best of
yes exact that's the beauty in it but it's extremely hard anybody who thinks he can be a everybody thinks oh you're funny you should be a standup
oh my god you're so funny really go on a stage with twelve strangers it's late at night they're a little drunk they're in a bad mood go make them laugh go ahead now tell me how good you are
comedian today obviously is chris my favorite standup comic of all time i thought was richard pryor
but he was the first to bring actual stories and make them
you know to me richard pryor is you know i mean i have robin williams i think is
he was so fast i i was just fascinated by him i mean you know eddie murphy and all those guys i mean they owe a lot to richard i think because richard was just i mean i saw that that special and i remember people people
standing up having to stand up and walk to the aisle because they were laughing so hard they could not sit down i remember
he is but i think he was you know he'd just he'd just broke new ground and he was he was my favorite favorite
well how could you not be i mean you know like you know there are certain people that come along in lifetimes who change the they change the game you know
uh you know he did richard did you know uh marlon brando did in the fifties and and then it wasn't changed again till robert de niro did raging bull in the
you change a style of acting you change where actors gain the weight and did all that it's it's those people that you have the
both i saw all a a lot of his shows in fact that i thought they were just terrific all of them
a linear story see most stand up most one man shows they do a character then they talk to the audience they break the fourth wall where this was where bronx tale onstage was a linear movie all the characters straight through without stopping that's why that that was a
not on not on tape yet no no i will i am gonna film it i was gonna do it i i recently on
it was on broadway then i just did it in las vegas at the uh
and i was a band i was in a band called razzmatazz and we worked
one of the places uh i used to work at the concord hotel many years ago up in the catskills and
how did you bring it back after all these years and the reason why i brought bronx tale back was because when i first did it it was such a phenomenon and everybody loved it so much
get a chance to really perform it for a long time i did it in uh la for a few months then i
in new york for like four months to sold out audiences and for all these years for the past almost nineteen twenty years people have been saying i love the movie i love this movie but i saw the play oh the play was great so i thought about it and i said you know what there's a whole new generation of people who never got a chance to see it i'm gonna bring it back and i decided to bring it back and i got back on broadway and it was a bigger hit than it was when i first did it
great movies right out of the box and and you know kinda three classics that are people still remember so i you you asked me what my favorite was other than bronx tale which is obviously my favorite i would have to say bullets bullets and usual suspects though and you know what i did a a film called a guide to recognizing your saints that i really love with shia labeouf and channing tatum and robert downey jr that came out
it didn't really get a lot of uh attention it got great reviews but it didn't do great at the box office but it's still a great movie and i really like it
haven't had a chance to work with marty and i know him i met him and i got to know him through bob de niro but i never got a chance to work with him yet for whatever reason but and i hope
there's this movie called safe which was written by richard vetere that i'm producing that i'm gonna play uh the lead character eddie uh that's one uh i'm trying to think and there's another one
a movie called the oogieloves it's about for kids and i love doing animation but this is more than animation this is actually i'm
i may be doing a movie right after this uh called exit one oh two in jersey
you know i enjoy it i have a great time you know uh get a chance for my wife and my children uh to come
i started out as a singer actually in a doo wop group so uh i really connected with the
the usual suspects so i'm known for those movies but this is a departure
now all of a sudden it's two oh eight and we're broke we have no money so we decide to pull off a job so i think the relationship we had was
okay uh yes i am a writer i am a director and yes i have strong opinions on all movies that i
director and the writer let me do it and sometimes they just wanna leave it the way it is but i i'm confident enough that if i can give a suggestion they take it but always i always remember that in the movies the director is the captain of the ship and he's the one who makes the final
say so but i i have uh helped write some of the movies that i've been in not this one
i wanted to write something about the working man all these mafia movies that glamorized the wise guys
they it was bothering me so i wanted to talk about the working man you know the italian american community is really just made up of the working people the bakers the firemen the
little aberration in the italian american community so i want to talk about lorenzo palminteri who said the working man is the tough guy i'm the tough guy it doesn't take much strength to pull a trigger but get up in the morning and i wanted to create that theme and talk about a bronx tale so to me a bronx tale is a movie
you're instinctual you train and you do the best you can and the way i kept them separate was i had to make each person sound
sisters the father spoke at a at a low register sonny spoke at a very high a higher register but more of a stronger bronx accent so that's how you really do that so if you have three or four of them speaking at once the audience can know who's talking
that keeps the book from being tabloid and honest it's not like when i peed in my pants when i
kids in like chinese costumes and dragons and candy and and we went in this room and and the big curtain went up and then there were all these animated characters dumbo and his
well no they but they're all good things but it i don't wanna tell it because i want you to read
help him with his car and we would talk and he was really nice and then when his friends would come over to visit him he would just tell me to run along so this one time he invited me to go well let me let me set this up he would come to my house and we'd watch tv and we'd kiss but he was always trying to get me to do more things and i just didn't want to i wasn't ready so um
he invited me to go to dinner and my mom said it was alright cause my mom didn't like me going out in cars with guys that were older my mom said it was alright and i was so excited and just as we were getting ready to go his friends came up and he said oh cher thanks for helping me you can run
so this makes me sound like a terrible person but you know i was only fourteen and a half
we used to go to this he liked to play hooky from work and so we used to go to this
we'd known each other for a long time well not a long time but i mean a while he'd decided that he liked me at this time and well one day we were at this park and this guy's playing really bad saxophone next to us and like just blowing himself up you know he's like just loving himself to death
yeah i guess so is this you know so i mean that just it's a nothing it's a nothing story you
the guy was blowing the bag sacks the people were in the park playing frisbee dog frisbee and
and he was he was married he was getting a divorce and i wasn't eighteen
we had a wedding ceremony i performed this wedding ceremony in our bathroom
before the sonny and cher show and after i got you babe we were literally in the toilet we owed the government two hundred and seventy thousand dollars and i had just had chad
and there was no more record sales there was no you know huge arenas with
and but meanwhile we had to go play these horrible places
and it was awful and i had made the mistake of telling sonny once that i knew a song from madame butterfly
it it would just not working so that night a woman comes up to me after the show and she said you know i came all the way from i don't know where
no it was like one of those times where you know my grandmother was very you you're very young and you've got this fabulous future ahead of you and you're not
and the only job my mom could get was you know working in an all night diner for tips and she
i kind of did from the from my first film you know the first time my my mom took me to the movies and i just thought i'm gonna do that when i
he was handsome and funny and very intelligent and a terrific actor and
and i know what he had on i know the watch the shoes every single thing and
also i'd get really shy and he'd say cher it's just me for god's sake just do it
and something really to look forward to because by that time our career had tanked and and we were just about to have to go
and that was playing all these really horrible nightclubs
and the people disliked us so much in the beginning that we would have two shows a night and no one would come to the second show so we would just start entertaining the band and that's where we started just
the strange thing is was that as partners we got along so well
the male personality and even discovered a few new ones you are physically repulsive
talking last night sorry he and i were talking before when i talk about chaz it's she and now when i talk about chaz it's he but so he and i were talking last night and i was saying to
i i think my reaction was great i said well if you've gotta do it if that's gonna make you happy then go ahead and do it
people are kind of afraid of strong women which is so wrong because
you just can't because you are that person you can put layers you can put new clothes you can do all kinds of stuff but you are the person that that you are the inside is what you are you can polish the outside but the inside
i wanna i'd like like i just wrote a script with a friend of mine for
you know and and like there are things that i enjoy doing and i'm happy when i'm
this but it does this album does have a lot of a lot of effects on it and it's just
i got at first you get great songs and i think i managed to do that this time i think i managed to get
no i mean because i i do what i do and it's all well and
it's not rocket science it's just something you know but i i believe that i believe that it's a
and it's kind of my process is difficult i wish it wasn't but that's it just i am who i am so
make it probably more difficult than i need to but i do there's a certain part that i enjoy
some of it but i i like i like when it's done i like having
and i actually enjoy certain things i really enjoy while i'm doing them and many things i enjoy
three or four i would probably pick um lie to me my love
i don't know i hope you find it it's hard though because all of them they're they're really different and i like them for different reasons you know dressed to kill is just stupid and funny and
camp and you know kind of playful and not trying to be anything serious the only song that really i'm like sirens is serious um i hope you find it is serious light of me is serious
of songs anyway i like you know i have a big voice i like to use it and and i just put it out there i'm not putting it out as
relationship with it you know it's like because music doesn't it bypasses your brain and goes right to that inside place
well the tour is next um well i it's not next but it
like when i was writing the script when i was running i was running the script i was like
all i could think about that's all i could do i'm kind of the person i'm just i
i think his autobiography is a real testament to him and his soul and his ability to withstand this extraordinary experience and that lion exactly that lion when he's hanging from the tree and he and he has this moment when he is like well many years later where he's writing about that moment and it just goes to show i think the depth of his soul
it it was in that moment in the book that i realized that he was kind of he had a
and actually doing that scene and doing the stuff around the with the tree and the and the
think it's uh just a i i think what steve has is uh i i i don't think it's a a racial issue exactly i think that steve is um an exceptionally talented
and i think that that really came into play in this i mean i'm sure that he is connected to the material in a very strong way being from you know his heritage is from the west indies and of course there was massive trade in the west indies in slavery but uh and that's probably one of the reasons he was drawn to the material but i think that his strength um with this is is the same as his strength in hunger and in shame i think he's just a
the the levels and the layers in the society you know the the industry of it all which is why in this you know we have um you know solomon starts off
and the timber and well you know going and and cutting trees and trying to and rafting trees down the down the swamps and the marshes in uh in louisiana and then he goes into
and this this sort of society of that as well and there are surprising characters alfre woodard in the film playing mistress shaw is a very interesting and surprising part of the whole infrastructure and um and i think that that's what the book and the that's what the film gives us it gives us a whole section of that society and uh and the industry and the mechanics and the
the well a lot of the information is out there you know um i don't know if we were specifically taught about slavery when i was in
uh i don't know if uh but it's something that obviously growing up is something that i have um taken on and looked at in many different ways in many different parts of um um times in my life and and um and in different places you know um not only the west indies and obviously britain's relationship to that but
uh in africa in in nigeria is where my heritage is and and where a lot of slaves came from um so it's always been something that has been of great relevance to me um um
looked at uh not just in the american slave issue but the kind of global ramifications of that i think it was i mean slavery was such an international event uh that affected the entire diasporan and still
um to the biography because i thought that if i if they hadn't i would have heard of this story i thought it was uh it was such an extraordinary story um such an amazing story so kind of unique in its
and uh and so powerful and and rich and you know this firsthand account of these events is um from so deep within the slave experience was just uh
know it and so i was very surprised to then read the book and realize that they hadn't made this seismic change and and it was very
to the way that it's written which is actually very instructive about him somehow and you sort of really get a sense of who he is um and that kind of quietness
well there was this sort of in a way there was um obviously the the just the detail in the book was very significant but there was also something just about the wider
there and it and it was something that just sort of tied into the book in a way and um you know just
of sugarcane the industry of of cotton um was just to understand where in the world he was
sort of geopolitical financial reality and and circumstance of of slavery of the slave trade and the relationships there
and and circumstance of of slavery of the slave trade and the relationships thereby between africa and and europe and america north america and south america it was just a very fascinating kind of way of
a more inventive and kind of despicable maze of of getting slaves down to the south so there was something there and then it was just a question of sort of narrowing in the book was incredibly helpful and and then just really even just learning the violin was just a way of you know of really kind of
you know um i just thought it was unlike anything i'd seen before uh and then and shame i thought was brilliant and so i was very excited i spoke to him after hunger not
and it was uh we talked about life and films and and wanted to work together on
so this was an amazing sort of coming together of that journey you know after um after a few years and um and the experience of working with him is uh absolutely remarkable it had uh it was an intense experience you know uh but that's exactly what it kinda needed to be um in a way there was only in a way that was the only way to tell someone's story is
you know extraordinary ever since we kinda opened in and toronto
it's been an incredible kind of journey with it and and and to be able to to talk to people in depth about it and to and and also people teach you about the film by the way that they respond to it and the conversations that they want to have about it and that's been incredible as well and so it's the whole process has been this really gratifying journey and and and and or any of the
it's it's a kind of part of the same thing i mean it's already been this kind of amazing amazingly
when i finished reading i was really kind of almost uh surprised at how much michael had stayed with me through it
uh and i realized that actually he was just a very just a very special character a very um determined guy but is you know just very um compromised all the way along compromised um by his situation compromised by the um the work that he's doing uh for the for the russian mob essentially compromised because of his family
michael is somebody who has a deep desire to to be a
um to teach your son certain things but has a life that is which means that he's has totally absolutely no control over
no no way of really of really being a proper father to his
um and therefore kind of carries that section of the story in a certain way and uh and we go on the journey with him we understand when he's when he's compromised and we feel the walls coming down around
uh he's also himself an ex cop but him being russell's brother means that there's a certain affinity therefore between michael and gabe which the others don't have and um um but he's also he can be a bit of
it's always great when you have a director like that who is uh talented and also incredibly personable and charismatic because you know it sort of affects
engaged by somebody in you know a rehearsal just sitting around
in the hotel reading bits of the script and feeling you know just so incredibly well prepared and extraordinarily well prepped and
and just uh just generous with it you know ready to kind of give it all and to um and to and to really get
and and john hillcut obviously it just uh just sort of capturing moments you know uh uh and it sort of just started to feel very organic and very sort of very
every single person is not only going to be talented as an as actors and have
journeys as actors like totally different journeys just as people you know um but uh but a completely
charismatic then determined you know and exciting actors to watch and be
adam poole i mean i mean he's great and uh and he's i mean constantly been putting out these great
and so now with this again the kind of opportunity to play this sort of
the guy that's kind of a little bit off the wall hard to pin down and he really embraces all of that and really really
you know and uh and a and a jovial um sense of the world you know which uh which is just above this kind of very steely very serious kinda energy this very kind of uh very determined working
and he can have that sort of duality which i find exciting and almost mercurial
and so him playing franco is just you know just perfect you know this kind of you know this totally morally compromised cop
deeply kinda complex guy that you feel this huge amount of emotion for that you're kind of um that you're you're right with him every step of the
you know that the uh that you don't that you're supporting one character for a moment and then it twists around and you're in somebody else's pocket and you're feeling different things about different people all the way through the
geek booth babe she gets paid to do this i bet she doesn't even know what
make her costume i know the girl who made it what is she doing cosplaying as this
if i told you that a lot of this comes from other cosplayers on
uh i will be on a show called heroes of cosplay that will be airing on the syfy channel it is essentially a reality show about cosplay the reception so far in the cosplay community has been
is done doing that because they're kind of realizing that we're actually taking over the world video games are making more
but people are so protective they're so protective of
afraid to post things online because of how cruel people can be and i'm not talking about the trolls i'm talking
my apologies why are you apologizing for something you haven't posted yet because you know it's a dick thing to say everyone has the intuition if you are thinking there is no reason i should post this it's going to hurt their feelings then don't post it not just on behalf of myself but on behalf of cosplayers out there
that you want that you may not have been able to otherwise if you didn't have a sewing
a community instead of a fucking battlefield also there's no such thing as a fake cosplayer or a real cosplayer because there is no grand high arbiter of
let people wear sexy costumes if they want to wear sexy costumes you can
and were real people before you start tearing my friends down or me just stop and think what good am i putting out in the world by writing this nasty comment maybe this comment that i am writing is discouraging someone from getting into cosplay just think before you post please
before the show aired if you have any experiences that you'd like to share or would like to add something to the conversation please post in the comments below and i will be joining in i hope you guys enjoy heroes of cosplay uh and if you don't uh there's always
since i was thirteen years old and i always played games since i was five and i somehow realized at some point when i went to a convention in new york i realized that you can actually make a living out of loving video games and so
reviewing games is that i pretty much get paid to sit on my ass and play games and eat bad food well i don't get paid to
think that i grew up in this sort of weird scifi star wars world because my dad did the visual effects on star wars on on the original one but in truth i mean i just sort of found my
i know that i'm a geek is it i i fly to conventions when they're not
gaming when i was five years old um just because it was a a whole other world and it was so beautiful like to go play video games or to play dungeons and dragons i mean i didn't play when i was five but as i got older i started playing
a dwarf and he got killed in battle which happens pretty rarely but it happens so
down to the third uh chance to bring him back and essentially if somebody rolled a a bad roll
over like a nineteen in order and i was i'm a rogue
twenty i rolled a natural twenty and saved my friend's life the chances of that were so minuscule and everybody cheered and got up and it was one of the most
uh a roleplayer actually helps with acting as opposed to acting helping with roleplaying uh because you are so much more inclined you want to be this character it's a character you created from hand so it's a good way
i hope to uh create my own tv show uh with all sorts of nerd culture with games doctor who and all sorts of things for everyone
ideally i would love to collaborate with all these people in this cool nerd circle there's ton
youtube channel um i probably have picked up a couple new people uh since all these crazy videos came out diego's a
statement if you will i'd like to talk first about the major announcement video
out of my way trying to get this interview and when i first went up to the pr people at the microsoft
they were having none of it they're like reddit uh don't want to touch that and i begged them like oh we'll do an appointment next week
they'll never do an appointment and finally uh i got an appointment i said only ask the softball questions nothing crazy which
back the next day for my appointment and they said well we have a major announcement for you and i just was like what you what we do what so i was
very very lucky and i was very grateful to get that interview with him uh now the pr person went over the list of questions that i had for him and she's like do you think we could skip this one and this one i said i'm sorry i gotta ask it i just have to ask it
and so i did i did the interview uh i was sitting there major nelson was so wonderful so personable and friendly and uh there was a pr person off to the side making sure i asked the right questions which it didn't really matter i asked all the questions that i had and she made sure that the interview didn't go south and you know what microsoft is covering their ass which
pretty smart right now and it was nice enough that they granted me the interview but this is why
didn't want to represent reddit unfairly if my opinion was one thing and somebody else's
maybe have some coffee or something i'd just really like to talk about the xbox one just all the
good parts and bad parts the benefits the negatives why we can't get rid of drm completely i mean obviously people aren't very happy and there's been a very very
things could be rectified you know things could be rectified well at least you know my
centauring isn't real i wasn't i didn't really want to make a meme and it ended up on the front page of r cringe which i had been following religiously and now i'm just sort of starting to realize it's just a place to try to bully people and the people who are doing the bullying are
not so smart ones because they don't seem to understand that a lot of the stuff on is actually ironic or
funny to watch all the people not get the joke because it was just so full of hatred and vitriol and i was just like well i'm not taking it personally it's just weird to see all this anger and hatred bubbling up in people so much so that they have to comment you're a fucking idiot
and super wonderful and lovely and it was obviously the people from arkrand that came in and tried to troll the shit out of me and i i wanna thank you guys for being so supportive um i plan to have a lot more cool stuff happening on this channel i promise i am upgrading from this stupid laptop camera within the next month or so and i'll actually have some kind of cool content for you well i'm working on it i'm working on it
but i am obsessed i'm completely obsessed i can't play it alone cause i just scream and it's terrifying and i pause every twelve seconds so i'm getting through it slowly but i'm getting through it it's
um i um no i think i always dreamed of being respected but um i i never i never had any um uh aspiration of of being famous or just being known
of which escapes me but um and i remember the credits came on and i remember asking my mom why it was over and i just
first thing you think like as soon as the pilot airs the first time and suddenly it's gonna be this huge thing and you won't be able to walk outside but it doesn't quite work that way it's more of a gradual process but
if i was recognized or maybe it was um uh maybe it was the first time that i i drove up to paramount studios and and had a place for my car to go and
told no by the people in their environments by bullies at school that they can't be who they are or have
i think i maybe somewhere in my in my mind i i knew that when i made that speech that that kurt was affecting more than just gay kids he was affecting a lot of kids that are just being bullied in general so um i think maybe that's why i don't remember that moment at all i i was in such an adrenaline high that i i i can't recall anything
whose music i liked like everyone before her i really i didn't care for too much like um like growing
well here's the thing what if something else comes along and they think no that gay kid from glee didn't give me a picture i'm
positivity towards the situation and not negativity but um i i certainly hope so and i i certainly have have witnessed firsthand uh
whenever i call my my dad is always over the moon excited and just so proud and
the security risks and and the um the security issues that um
are very frightening that the people don't know that because i don't want them to know that um but uh
want them to stop you want you want it to stop on the other hand you know that if you since you are in the public eye that if you you are a raging
jerk and and say get off me leave me alone then you know it's gonna be written about the next day and uh and
cause i think that there's always the the question if like what people's real intentions are but um i don't know i i think you just
if i'm sobbing maybe like a minute to get things running down a minute or um if it's just like a if you need like one or two then it like like a couple
things that i'm up to um i'm doing a um i'm developing a uh television show for disney right now um um
during um our summer hiatus we all went on tour and then i was the idiot who decided to do a movie the day uh we got back from tour i started and the day before we started season three i finished the movie so i filmed a movie over my summer
go back to a a a new year of school like you see all your old friends uh you plan your outfit the night before um you buy you know pencils and pens i don't need those but it just you know it's a mindset so i have to buy those um yeah it's just like going
three kurt is a senior and um he's very much uh looking forward to graduating and and moving away from lima ohio and uh he and rachel are
i cannot believe it took us this long season three to do we got the beat by the go go's i cannot believe it because it just
it's really weird um seeing myself in in interviews
whenever i'm uh you know playing curt from you know from six o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock at night every day i i noticed that like my own personal mannerisms tend to change a bit like especially when i'm in interviews like i'm much more high pitched in interviews i'm much more excited in in interviews and and then like over the summer when i shot the movie i was playing a different character who's very subdued and very rude and and and um and uh sarcastic and i noticed that that i was much more subdued in interviews and and my voice was a little
interviews and i was a little more serious so um i don't know i think maybe i'm i'm more
if we changed if we change the words a little bit like i said s and m it could be vocal adrenaline maybe
if i had to join to do that no i wouldn't have to it could be in your
yes s and m by rhianna or um sexy back from
not tell you how many times i get stopped in the street people think that i'm justin timberlake i cannot tell you
that and justin bieber can you believe that people always assume that i'm justin bieber but
reasoning why i think that's what happened yes all the time but this is the reason why i think cause people see me on the street and they know they know me from
occurs i mean this this is me talking normally of course if i wanted to you know uh try to uh
because i mean i think i think it did change i think i just went from up here to
and um and we'd ask is my voice going to change and they'd be like well you're um eighteen
and i would you know i'd cry um but uh but no i mean i mean it's it's gotten me where i am now
oh yeah oh yeah all those things and i was like okay who who do i like bribe to get this but um but it was just i just such an
it's amazing to be in a room where like you know that every single person was a leader of a country or or like i sat next to the man who um started the uh egyptian
on his computer and then i'm thinking of all the crazy stupid things like with my chewbacca
i think so yes and i had a friend we were on set we were we were very bored so we um kind of came up with like the concept for
it and then suddenly i i hope she said something about being uh having a full circle moment and i'm like that's so
it was um i work for the um course one center um yeah and that was that was great again free food
um and uh and it's actually it's funny because i was there a a year ago um uh like a a few weeks back and um i was there for the easter egg roll last year and uh we had quite the weekend that that that week for glee cause we were at oprah first and then we went to the white house and oprah has better security
at the white house because they never once scanned me or put me through a metal detector or
shot the finale in new york and it was insane cause there were there were cause the fans knew we were there and they're around us constantly um but um it was a very expensive episode
i knew i wouldn't remember any plans um that i would make anyway the next morning um but it's it's really sad cause i see bar right there and i
morning is generally the kind of witching hour and uh everybody's asleep and so i just go down and sit for maybe like three or four hours and
fleshed out and doesn't have a guitar riff and we don't think anything's i don't think anything's finished right until everybody's put
that if you i think the only thing an audience responds to is if they think you don't care so if you start out big or you start out tall or you start out whatever and that's your thing then that's great you know so but it's if it's if you let it look like you don't give a shit anymore and you just spent the whole time partying
it's because it's it's making something public that really wasn't designed to be you know it just it happens that those are our individual
well i'm just saying it's just what makes you feel comfortable and we and we don't really feel comfortable in that
well it's just i i think with any of our songs that have gone on to do okay i don't really know how they came through they just sort of it's that old cliche that everyone says paul simon eh all of the people all of the songwriters say it it's that the good ones just kind of
now that's more of a concern because nobody really buys albums anymore but
still a few still we're in the business of making albums so we we need the sort of scope of that but you know the song will never be like a hugely popular song but just fits in the whole
musicians and artists were were just working for patrons and maybe we're just going
uh so well okay so if i think if people stopped coming to our shows and uh if if everybody wasn't paid at all it would be a
my dad just came out came through i'll tell you exactly how it happened we were in wales and um
and uh we always can't wait to do it again but whenever we finished a
we love playing it i don't know i think it's the same as seeing your baby pictures or something it's very embarrassing when people
you need that so we so we really listen intently to anything else that comes out and then we also listen to sergeant pepper and
and now it's what we do it's like winning the presidency or something in my
well we can be totally inspired and try and do the i know
it can always be better some this we were walking down on bronte beach
and and uh one of them's like ah man i love the music and then another one was like
it's funny because when someone insults you like to your face about your
i had this woman the other day who was for some reason parked outside
and i'm not proud of it but it's it's weird how you're if you sort of feel like you're being
it's best to just let all that stuff go over your head sometimes i'm not you know you're
says oh that video you know is doing this and we often get like sad boyfriend stories which is sad but you know
point in the your point is i don't think it's any different playing to a hundred people to playing to twenty thousand in fact i find it easier to play to twenty thousand and to make it more intimate because i'm less intimidated by the one guy
my dad always used to tell me that as a young child and as an older child as a as a man as
to never give up and so uh yeah i i thought it would be a nice um thing to end the and then after that very suddenly it also says believe in love it was quite a hippie sentiment to go out on but
yes well one of them is um god thanks for asking about this man this is super cool one of them is this poem called the guest house which was written by a old turkish poet who
this guy from athens georgia called coleman barks started translating these poems for a western audience and this poem is about how every feeling that we have as humans is ultimately a blessing even though it really doesn't seem it at the time sometimes and when i when i got shown this poem about three or four years ago it really changed my life and way of looking at the world and so we put it in the middle of this album as a sort of thank you to that
and then after that we have a tiny clip of um the president singing
the the because of the historical significance of what he did i think and also that
yeah being about i was lost but now i'm found that that's how i feel about
we started to make a record called ghost stories which we put out last year which you very kindly interviewed me about
um the same time that the title of that came to mind the title i had for the dreams came to mind but i asked the rest of the band you know do you think we could make this one first the smaller one i was in a sort of more intimate small place musically
could we go right back in the studio and see how we're feeling and they said yeah so the title has been around for about three or four years but but we didn't start work on it until eighteen months ago
listening to that part i'm telling you about and by just slowly seeing
yeah if you wanna talk about that sure uh yeah we have tried really hard because just because a romantic relationship ends doesn't mean that the other facets of your relationship have to end or indeed
yeah really i i i'd done lots of work on it to just to realize how
that's how i that's really how i feel even on the days where i wake up and feel a bit depressed or a bit worried or whatever that well
you know i was a huge fan of little miss sunshine so um and i was watching to see what their next film would be i've been waiting and waiting and waiting because they are so um
uh and that quality is exciting to me to be they could've directed so many things but to so to see what they wanted to work on next was right there very intriguing and then when i read the
um i was blown away i i know paul and zoey from new york i met them on their first play um they did i was we have a mutual friend and i went to the show i i was blown away by their acting
uh went out to dinner that night and we started to develop a a
so the opportunity to get to act with both of them was uh something that i was super excited about there comes a time though i guess when when as an actor when you go like oh i can be a part of this you know it's going to be special you read the script and you see who is involved and you go you you it's not i want to it's i i i i have to you know
i've done that before um and it was also a good experience
um the other one they were just good friends and and and that worked out i i've heard stories with two directors where they're uh horror stories uh
people kind of contradicting each other and you have one voice and then you have another voice and with john and val um they have a system i don't know what it is but it works
it always felt like one voice um they are very specific and they know the film so well
uh and they dig around in the script and with the characters so much that um ultimately you end up just trusting everything
we ate together we listened to music and by the end of that process um
your brothers you know you you have you have a love for each other you learn about paul you learn about his process and you learn about calvin
you know i you know when i auditioned for this there was a lot of talk about we like him but he doesn't look like paul dano which i
i went and i we somebody's idea was to to dye hair lighter and my eyebrows lighter and i did that and i still didn't look anything like but that thing their philosophy that way of rehearsal that theater company that they put
so rare to have it most of the time you're rehearsing to um so when you get on the set you're
so excited that uh somebody was gonna take a a risk uh or a chance on me in in doing it and then when it's ben affleck doing it um
you know you feel like you uh struck gold um they don't make films like this and um and uh
i really love and uh and a big part of the reason i became an actor is because of the genre seeing godfather one and two uh and watching those actors work is um a big part of why i wanted to be an actor so it was a no brainer for me that uh this
and we uh we have a similar taste in films and uh ben's a cinophile so i can sit there forever and um uh kind of uh just chip away at his brain trying to figure out what movies he likes and why he likes that director and that scene or that actor and um so that's a lot of fun to do and we became friends and that kind of we could bring that
into this film and it kind of ensue the characters with that so it was easy and fun those days were we were on set together uh
i mean i've i honestly have never seen a car chase like that with these old cars in a movie before uh they they take days to do and it was very new for me but um uh he was great at guiding me along and um cause a lot of the times you're actually in the car and it's driving really fast and there's a a a a car in front of you with a crane that's following the car and it's very close or it's sometimes behind or sometimes it goes to the side and then sometimes you're on a process trail
and it and it feels ridiculous feels like you're kind of um on some kind of rollercoaster ride
and he would kind of insure me what how much how little what we needed for those pieces
you know like when you play you know i don't know when i was a kid i'd you know play like gi joe or you know uh
i'd play star wars and stuff and it felt it felt like that you just you looked at yourself in the mirror and you're like how the hell did i
i'd moonlight for him you know i would do craft service in the next movie whatever he needs i would i would be there in a second i'm uh indebted to him for his confidence in me
um you know he's got uh tons of options uh as an actor as a
um i i was given the script and it when i was given the script um
i i got more excited and and alex the character of alex
and i'd been talking for so long about directing a movie um
different ways of there are many different ways to make a movie or a television show
thing they wanna move the audience or make the audience laugh bring an audience on a on a ride but there's a lot of different ways of
think i had found early on that i had a particular way that i like to
directors and actors and writers and producers out um and
and and i always i try to be as honest as possible to the cast and the crew in saying i i wanna do
you know you may not like it and that's okay you don't have to like it but if you do this film i want you to try to embrace it you know
the camera for about twenty seven minutes which is what the card could hold
but um but great for finding truth in
see themselves and loved ones in it um we we wanted to be as honest as we could so
it is so funny cause it kinda throws you because it's the librarians it's basically indiana jones with a lot of magic my dear friend noah wyle started this ten years ago as a matter of fact it airs uh
enough to be an actor to get to play some of the roles that you grew up as a kid just loving it's been it's been i'm
the art and it's uh and it's something that i've always been been fond of so john rodgers who uh created the show and and and wrote this character with me in mind he he made this guy from oklahoma and an art history major so that was
tell you that i can think of that are different is the fact that we've got more technology now to make the monsters even better
finally did such a good job if you've seen the films then you know that noah started off sort of a geek sort of nerd and he's now become this force to be reckoned with as indiana jones well we're starting out like that you know we've got to find our
if it's something that's new i mean we had star trek we had all this other stuff let me explain i mean like i i love those shows alright i my good i have a good friend tony
it's great to be to watch a crime drama to watch a who did it well let's put them on trial let's put them away we have so many of those man and some people i think that's why leverage that i was on for so long was such a big big hit because people wanna sit back on the couch they wanna let go of their day they wanna crack a beer they wanna disappear that's one of the reasons i'm an actor is i saw
it's not being the thinking about work this is one of those shows it gets you out of the real world
first thing i just saw was so cool i want to go back into that world because i used to live there i
but i was always getting beat up my friends were at the movies i went to i went to the movies on the weekend
you know and not to just go off tom cruise but then he did cocktail so i wanted to be a bartender and then i saw another one i was like oh i'm gonna be a firefighter i'm i'm gonna be this i'm gonna be that and then one day it just hit me i was around fourteen years old i said i can just be an
it's a it's a job but it's i haven't worked a day in my life in this business to be honest with you it's a job you go to work and it's fun and it's what i wanna do and it's my job
if you're in a coliseum you know what i mean so it's like that's something that you know i can go out on the street and do a little bit of acting and maybe get locked up but if i go out there and play a little music i might even
dean devlin was uh i was fortunate enough dean devlin is off doing geostrom right now with gerard butler big big movie in louisiana and he had the cameras left over from the librarians and i asked i said can i borrow them for a couple days and he's such a nice guy and he's been a friend of mine for years he said take them so in about a week in a half we set up shop in portland oregon and shot the
going to be a part of it um john rogers wrote it and created it and he kind of wrote this role for me actually
behind the couch and my agent called and said man did you read the script i got you yeah it's not for me it's not
lot of fun it was uh i i actually play play kind of a james bond type guy and uh and
always great always great to have someone who is an
he's the man behind leverage and you snap to it you know when he's around very relaxed very relaxed uh atmosphere he's
wasn't even written though we had the best i honestly feel like we had the best writers in town
he told me a story he said most of the crap that happened between will smith and
not scripted will did it he came up with that so dean as an actor that's so
and that's where you grab something great i honestly believe that because everybody's
the the amazing the the actual the real cowboy and the american movie star tom selleck i just i can't say enough about
uh which i was very proud of i was i uh that that i got to play i'm cherokee so i got to play
i don't really look that indian but i got to play a half half breed i
he was singing and i did this and i went up actually when i first went up to los angeles the first role i got was a was a was a
than i do though it's not that i'm an actor i'm just kinda doing this on the side i really honestly i moved to nashville i've lived in
to do that it was it was leverage that brought me back to los angeles cause i was living in nashville only
you know i get up and i show up and i go to i go to what they call work i'm paid to do what i do and somebody's paying me so
uh i said yes to it because you know you need some money every once in a while but uh other than that i
and uh and we have really really enjoyed it and uh you know god willing if we get to go another season we're we're
you know as actors and and and the producers as well we love the city we love the people we love the food and the wine and everything else you know we've all got
i do i have a good lock on mine i don't know if it's exactly as strong as tim's but then again i wouldn't wanna steal
bit little bit of the of the countryside does a little bit we're not quite as hilly as you guys but at the same time the people are
no they haven't they've actually been really really great you know they don't really bother me they they bother they might say something to tim or something but it's not bothering us we're here this is what we chose to do for a living so if we can't you know we gotta accept the fact that we're in your hometown this is not a
in la people don't really come up to you that much because it's la and you know but it but you were in portland and we're
seventy thirty thirty percent we're like he's got a i don't understand he's supposed to be this tough guy and he's got this long hair that's flowing around but then seventy
we're we're foodies you know we like really enjoy food and really enjoy a good wine with food tim's tim
yeah but um but so so that in in that that means that you know i i we like to find great places to hang little joints we call them to do some food and we'll shoot some pool and we'll
i write my own i write my own songs so that's some some i don't if i if i find a really good
coming out on wednesday it's called let me go it's written by uh casey beathard and tom shapiro really good friends of mine that i always write with uh you know they've written number one
for years they've done that and so that's gonna be the single coming out and uh mr bob ezrin is producing my album which i thought unbelievable this guy i'm gonna be the first country guy that he's done uh bob ezrin did the kiss albums
numerous different reasons one would be the tax incentives another one is because portland's such a great backdrop but at the same time oregon has always been one of our
i mean we were left with a huge cliff hanger which was the car accident and so it picks up with what the family's left with after you know recovering from that huge accident um thankfully everyone is okay
still struggling with the whole matt going on tour the idea of that
dyed her hair or she's pierced her nose just for a boy you know she's
issues and she's never really been okay with herself and knowing that she's enough so for
owed i mean it's callie's ex boyfriend so um
foster household you can't have secrets for very long so the season
yes jude is going to be throwing callie a surprise birthday party and there's gonna be a surprise guest that mariana completely is
well it's definitely progressed especially from the first season um she's not using anymore and she's just had her baby morna's helping her and she's recovering from the accident so she's kind of taking
um i'm not their relationship has definitely blossomed and it's turned into something really great and
and i think it's so true and it's it's really changed my whole idea i mean a friend can be just as much family as
i don't know it's it's it's definitely changed my it's just a lot broader
and i i mean i love family and i'm all about that so to be able to be a part
definitely i mean that's what it the show is at the end of the day i mean they all have their own
definitely and through the show we've gotten opportunities to meet with a lot of
like like girls united so that's been really fun and and to hear their stories and to see if they relate or resonate with a certain storyline or character it's been really cool cause it's it's
the writers have done a really good job of of bringing a lot of very
and real stories to life um and and the some of them you know we uh have not very like strayed very far
a lot of betrayal a lot of secrets a lot of lies a lot of
good girl to bad girl i just loved that whole aspect of her and i loved taking on that role
you know rehearsing everything which helped me become ansiedad pretty much and just working off and like feeling off of her with my lines and everything it was just a great experience all
i think that anyone can relate to this because of the fact that you know they're both trying to still find themselves and
she just needs that love from her mother i just think everyone needs that that bond
she's so fun to work with and so fun to hang out with we were always
now she she helped me so much through like the entire process becoming ansiedad she she showed me so many things that like i
i i never would have learned after this so i've learned so
i could see it like after the rehearsals that i'd become a different person
that sometimes growing up means acting your age and i think that's so important because you know just because grace is has a daughter doesn't make her a mother exactly so
being loved and being loved back you know loving someone and loving getting love
you know i just whenever i think about him being on set i just i love it cause you know he was so sweet he's so down to earth always bringing
the crew and the cast and it was just great and he's so funny he's so funny there isn't a time where he's not making me
honor to be nominated i'm so excited and i'm actually presenting for my first time tonight as well so i'm really excited for that just
crazy first off i was thinking oh my gosh these set decorators need to design my
bittersweet we were really sad we were gonna be leaving each other for a couple months but we were also really
we've met back up with my castmates at the teen choice awards but only for a couple hours everyone has their own schedules and are so busy but i'm really excited to be coming back in the fall just can
oh she's very adventurous i'm i'm kind of a homebody i'm i'm not very well i actually i am dramatic but not as dramatic or sassy i do applaud
i'm originally from there so i've been been able to go back and visit lots of my family and friends a lot of my friends are going off to college so i've been able to kinda
so i'm really excited for that um music's originally how i got into acting so
no um i'm currently kind trying to kinda find my sound um i would
influenced as a young child uh with by etta james patsy
people like that so i i really love that soul aspect of music but i love everything you hear on the radio so i'm trying to find a nice
so pretty soulful i love amy winehouse love adele
penny did physical comedy and they wrote toward her strength which was natural because that character was so
and uh i kept saying to garry i do physical comedy too i go back to the ice cream social at reseda methodist church um
so i i kept saying that to him and saying that and finally one day he said
i'm gonna give you a chance and i'll see you know i'm gonna write you something and see how you do
so i think the bit was she gets a vacuum cleaner when we're cleaning
get it off of her mouth and i think i put my foot on her chest and
that and so then after that he said you're right you can do physical comedy and then and then we started then it started becoming a show i guess this was the second season and we'd have the block scene where it would be at the end of the show something big would happen and it would be very physical we had
physically fit i'll put it that way did penny and i wanna exercise look at me no neither one of us wanted to we just wanted to eat you know
and some potato chips and a pepsi to wash it down and go to bed
no we didn't no in fact the stuntmen's association made us honorary stuntmen and gave us buckles oh where is that buckle mm i gotta find it but uh no we didn't see why you know it's funnier if you put a stunt double
the physicality is different the rhythm is different so we didn't even think about that i mean we were grateful and the and the women that came on the show were wonderful but they just became background action and stood around and you know
i'm not you know it goes along with my dyslexia i can't i can tap dance a little she's a dancer i can move um
roller skate and twirl a baton penny can do it and i i i was just i would say yeah yeah yeah i'll do that i'll have that down by you know by the time we shoot ah yeah yeah
i wouldn't and i'd crash into things or i'd fall or i'd you know i just there were certain things i couldn't do and and it dealt with like usually on roller skates i can't do a cartwheel either and we had to do cartwheels and one leg is crunched up her cartwheel's great mine is just like a scrunched up cartwheel and then we once had to do like russian dancing where you do squats and get on your feet oh
that was tough i kinda did that the things i couldn't do i kinda
wasn't afraid to be humiliated because i knew it'd make people laugh and so therefore it's not a
and ron and i ron howard and i went to meet him after we when we were set to do the film we had this quick meeting with him and he described the film as a musical to us he said because the music will never stop during the whole film except when the source of
but the car has been stolen or there's a crash cause it's all takes place in one night with the radios going and you know and cruising and we thought wow what genius that is so but we felt we were making kind of this hot rod movie this low budget hot rod movie and uh and george was just one of us you know we were all um peers
he we'd shoot at night from six at night to six in the morning cause it all takes place in one night at but george would have to because it was so low budget he would have to go and edit during the day right behind us so he'd edit and then he'd come back to shoot so he this went on for about you know a week and soon you'd be shooting a scene and no one would yell
and i remember one time ron and i had finished a scene and we just held and held and waited and finally ron said george george and and he popped up he was on the truck you know the camera truck following us he popped up and he said what and he said cut
and we said how was it and he goes terrific and if you ask anyone on that film that you know how did george direct and what did he you know what were his words to you it was one word
and um so it was it was like going to a risque church camp doing that movie it was there was a lot of mischief because you had paul le mat and and uh harrison richard dreyfuss and they were just you
uh six years younger than me and i was so afraid that that was gonna show on camera cause you know and so i
i well there was no hair and makeup there were wigs and there was no wardrobe uh person we had a winnebago with everything in it there were no dressing rooms or anything he was just wonderful and you know of course i had watched him on mayberry rfd and i knew him as opie and he
he was just wonderful but we'd be sitting in the car during the setup while haskell wexler and you know george were setting things up
he'd get out of the car and go and talk to haskell and ask him a question and you know and talk to george and then come back and sit in the car with me while we were waiting for the set up and i asked him what are you doing and he said i'm asking
you what he's doing and george you know and i i'm asking about the setup and the lighting because i'm going to direct one
so um the he was totally interested in the whole process of of the film
and um and we would rehearse together he was one of the few actors that rehearsed with me you know i mean ever in my career well penny but you know on a film cause they don't usually have a rehearsal before
in his acting and also in his observation of of the whole process and i guess it
took off and took everybody with it myself included so other than that i can't i can't answer that i mean i just all of a sudden there was this quasi fame this almost
but it didn't take me into laverne and shirley it
and i was also nominated which people don't know but i was nominated for the british academy award for
it's very tough you know she's very she has a mind like a steel trap she doesn't forget
i was just talking to her and she said didn't you read the email i sent you and i said no you know i don't read emails i'm computer illiterate she goes don't you do anything i go text me text me
um she she's a taskmistress she will have things uh she'll read the script and you know be smoking a cigarette and have it down in a day and i i'll hold the script right up to dress rehearsal and uh
and she can be impatient but along with
to be better and and try to be johnny on the spot and and it would be crisper because of her and uh
yeah well it's just so difficult but the so then the attitude of the characters were real you know when she'd get set with me it would be real and it just i just you know let it roll off my back after a while and didn't get upset by it but um
as far as rhythm went as far as the door flying open and both of us being absolutely in
i used to say to her if there were an olympic an olympic event for comedy i think we'd take the gold i used to say that to her cause we just physically we just do thing
the laughs some of the best laughs of my life were with that woman i mean and if we made each i go back to if we made each other laugh we knew we were would make the audience laugh also if it made us
close like that i mean very you couldn't slip a playing card in between us like that but we had our differences but not when it came to hitting that stage and and doing you know what we love doing and it was like instinct with her like telepathy
see our personalities are so alike in so many ways and so
in so many ways and we're both italian and loud and so some things
we would play it out you know we could we could get loud
i was upset about it you know and i maybe took the other side of it there would be squabbles but
the entire thing was such a blessing and so much
and i have to say we are great friends she's one of my great great
really great time working with gary the director um it's his first feature and uh there's always a risk involved when you work
director's never directed a feature before i'd seen his short film and really loved it and i like him a lot when i met him and spoke to him about the movie and uh and about his vision for it but you never know until you start shooting quite how the thing will will
is incredibly prepared always has a good perspective of you know
the script just in terms of the way you're coming at the characters and the way you're coming at the story and his
he's really impeccable with his choice of shots of where to put a camera and he comes in very clear he's not one of those directors who comes in and tries to find his way through the scene he comes in with a very clear idea about how he wants to tell this bit of the
uh i'm not just going uh you know i i find him you know a great collaborator of
you're hired as an assassin um his best friend and mentor has been captured and been told he will be
ex sas guys who did an operation that somebody wants them killed because of what they
i i might play a character who is ex sas who begins to realize that our people are being targeted
and i put together a group to try counter what they're doing and do it so it's it's a spy movie that has lots of very good action in it but it is based in a very real
real eighties world is this kind of period film and it feels like a a spy movie
a group called the feather men which are a group of ex sas people with that wield a lot of
that are there really to protect the interests of sas people or xss people and their families and it's a very secret clandestine group that meet
i basically play the sort of guy on the street
mm people who have had who have got strong attachments to the military i know i'm very much their guy on the street who's hearing the things and sort
about um um jason plays a character who's basically hired as an assassin um his best friend and mentor has been captured and been told he will be killed
pull a group together and and target these ex sas guys who did an operation that somebody wants them killed because of what they
and i play a character who is ex sas who begins to realize there are people being targeted and i put together a group to try and counter what they're doing undo it so it's it's a spy movie that has lots of very good action in it but it is based in a very real world
a real eighties world it's this kind of period film and it feels like a a spy
um certain people have been around asking questions about certain operations that the ss were involved in
and he begins to sort of set up a counterintelligence amongst us ex sas guys who uh who are now trying to find out what's going on and try and prevent their guys being
they don't actually know if you access so um i could pick their brains a bit and then um
uh uh um a couple of meetings with uh an sas consultant a guy who'd been in the sas for twenty five years and the interesting thing is he's
and it was it was fascinating really just to pick his brains about
the whole selection process for the ses i had no idea what that was like and to hear how rigorous that is and how very few people pass that sort of test procedure and it's pretty much the sort of people uh uh are showing themselves to be incredibly adept and incredibly skilled and then sort of selected and put through this process where
get get through so he he he taught me all about that whole process and also
he was a great sort of um explainer of what it's like to be ex sas in a way to be someone who there's something about this film
covers i think that's the most interesting aspect for me playing this part and why i wanted to explore it is when a guy's been that sort of highly trained and highly skilled and been inside extraordinary intense
it certainly helps if the team around you the stunt team are you know very experienced and very
and one thing you realize about directors is if they're very smart everything else falls into place
and everything falls into place everybody slots in everybody
that's where it's also emanating from and it's just about being smart as a human being
you know the the audience can empathize and sympathize with your allegiance is constantly switching
the piece because it's all meat and every single scene is a very intense situation with fantastic dialogue so every time you come to a
oh my god this is such an intense meaty powerful scene
that's why the piece is so exciting because if it works if it's pitched right and everything works everything comes together well the cumulative effect of having nothing
the meat of relationships one after the other
and there aren't that many you know we're in we're in an era where most movies are for teenagers or for kids and this is a genuine adult movie about what adults get
four weeks rehearsal for this and unusually and this is a very particular thing
rehearse the scenes we didn't just talk about the scenes and rehearse them we spent a lot of time
about the themes of the piece and talking about the characters collectively not not in a scene not saying well how does this work how does that work what's this beat about much more about the bigger themes of the piece
and the character traits how people how people behave under pressure how people behave when they're in love how people behave when they've been wronged how and that was a collective thing that everybody sits around and talks which is obviously you know it's
it was it was incredible because when it came down to it we all were
down my cast members they all ended up uh doing like a little fun premiere while we were there and uh the weekend
my you know my mom was in was just it was crazy i just got mobbed and i had never experienced anything like that before so it really was a a a shock to all of us but i for me you know my my uh family has always been all about keeping normalcy so it was it was never too
when you meet the director um then you go back in to sing you go back in to dance uh for the males you went back in to play
well you know the incredible thing is we all grew up together i mean and and it was during high school time i was sixteen when the first movie came out
the final scene of the third movie the final movie we shot that last so it really was the final curtain and you know you it the camera pans to each one of our faces
tears in our eyes and you could see us you know just sort of waving goodbye to this experience and this this group of people
the best part about it there was there was nothing that we had to procure for ourselves it was all organic and real
um well i i did go to a regular high school i went to an arts high school um and where i was surrounded by normal students and and at the same time i was going off and shooting movies as well so like i said my family always sorta kept a a normalcy to our lives um if anything you know it definitely was
you want to know something i i'm okay um i i can't even say that there was a chore that i hated doing the most cause to this day i'm
and yeah i mean so we met uh like four years prior to me doing dancing with the stars and we just hit it off we on a make a wish foundation event it was a cruise and uh
still coming off of high school musical and still coming off of um that hype and i i really for me i wanted to go and and do other projects for my career and and i i went off and i worked on broadway
you know a lot of your personal life um so the other thing that i was saying
we we sort of came up with that contemporary dance together and then
you you work on you know putting together uh performance you do it once
push i push it sometimes uh you know i have to whenever i'm working on a project i i take it easy a little bit the second i'm
moments on this film also because you know we filmed up in in vancouver uh it was around the wintertime
the weather was very schizophrenic and it would like pour and then it would be hot and then it would would snow then it would hail and you know especially when you're dealing with
riding in the mud i mean they and they come off that track just a mess i mean sometimes like it's
actually yes um there was one injury uh that uh i wasn't there to witness it but i i heard about it and it was actually
rolling over the bike and you know the stunt double who did it
and he did it and actually the shot that you see in the film that shot he broke his collarbone in that shot
so i mean you know i i mean that's but these guys though the motocross guys that's what they do you know they they get up on that bike they take a fall they get
do dane at the moment um if i if i'm not under
i mean for for me i'm i'm you know as as far as being on set i aways want to give a good performance so i mean that's that's never anything that changes but
i mean you know every once in a while you have a have a a mom who's living vicariously through their child that is a little bit
love my i love my my mom fans absolutely no i'm i'm saying the ones who are you know if you're saying if they get a little kooky yeah sometimes
of course freestyle will be out october ninth um there's also you know there's a few projects my production company was behind this film as well so there's a few projects that we uh through this through this company have have coming out through the
take hold of of of the project in a lot of other ways you know what i mean as far as even as far as casting as
though things you'd do differently next time and you know here and there so you know but overall i think we we we made a really good family film for this one you know we really just wanted to make something that was
was taking dance classes when i was at a very young age i started that to uh everything ballet tap uh
to to go into a whole bunch of other i mean other genres jazz modern hip hop break dancing salsa um
um that was the training when it when it when i was on set uh we had a coach and i i
had to work hard at it i mean i i i'm not very good at basketball so
did enough to to play a character that's supposed to be incredible at it um
it's interesting but stuff is always is is always thrown at chad bringing him out of his element
and during the first film that was it he he was a jock and he's comfortable with his basketball and then he kind of had to get used to the fact that troy
is gonna be involved in theater so that was that was one thing he had to let go uh the second movie was about him
um him kind of letting go a little bit more he he he got into dancing and got into theater himself uh which very out of his element not his thing at all
enjoy it but he does it because his friends do it and and he'll do it uh and this final movie is about uh
wants to really consider singing as a career option and and letting go of basketball um so for him he's losing his best friend and and and and letting go
you mean the junkyard number so awesome so so cool i mean we've never zack and i haven't been able to do a duet together we've um of course been in production numbers as an ensemble together but we've never had the opportunity to do a number with just us two so
mean we were in the the rehearsal studio together and just kind of really working on on the number and uh just really vibing off of each other and we we we really grew together too as as friends which is really cool um
can really you can really express yourself um you know that's why it's it's always so
for for schools even to to host host uh arts programs and and and to be able to to let let kids explore themselves
i mean no no matter what it is i i i think the more you do the better i mean you you as as as
it's never good to to just be stuck in one thing i mean i i for for me even though i'm not good at it when it comes to basketball and i'm not really not really um i don't really take to the sports as much um i'm happy that i i've had to force myself to get into them from doing these films uh just
to learn new things every single day and you gotta you gotta continue to ride yourself and and in life i mean as as people our our
make the most out of all you can throughout your entire life and and i mean there's so much out there to explore so much out there
um but it it's extended over a period of time and
uh there there were there were a a lot it was it was a time where we could we could
um and not just not just think about her death but but really uh have time to let those memories of her
about family and about the family in this movie that everybody can relate to is how you take on a role in your family
even if you are considered the most gregarious person in the world out in in the world if you have this incredibly gregarious
suddenly you're the quiet one um and and that's a a role that's often unique to
everybody gets forced into these childhood role
feels but it can also you know drive become very rageful yeah
support the family and um but of course i've held on to that that resentment and that's really
um but i think i think my character gets something from that too there's a certain you know self righteousness um and a sense of
um you know the very you know very very family
tone very early on that you he has this cast where there are people who've done a million comedies and feel very confident
communicability you know and when you go through the cast there's more people like myself who've never been in
there was such a sense of safety and and generosity and and a sense that
person for it and and i want to see your interpretation of it so that i i think we all felt
i felt totally comfortable to take risks and if it wasn't funny it didn't have to be um
we were that wasn't the intention the humor came from the reality of these family dynamics and and not uh not
and and other people but there was such a sense of safety
um but it's it's extended over a period of time and
uh there there there were a a it was it was a time where we could we could
um and not just not just think about her death but but really uh have time to let those memories of her
about family and about the family in this movie that everybody can relate to is how
you take on a role in your family you know even if you are considered the most gregarious person in the world out in in the world if you have
suddenly you're the quiet one um and and that's a a a role that's often
everybody gets forced into these childhood
uh family i've stayed behind i've uh you know ran the the the family business and made incredible
super ego of the entire uh family i've stayed behind i've uh
help support the family and um but of course i've held onto that that resentment and that's really
on to that that resentment and that's really sort of formed this that's really become
big house but not big enough for a crew of a hundred fifty people um so we were
really set the tone very early on that he has this cast where there are
feel very confident in their communicability you know and when you go through the cast there's more people like myself who've never been in
of you know uh comedy before i mean uh um sort of but you know i i uh that's not my thing uh and and other people but
there was such a sense of safety and and generosity
and and the sense that you've been picked for this role because i think you're the best
person for it and and and i wanted to see your interpretation of it so that i i think we all felt i felt totally comfortable to take risks and if it wasn't funny it didn't have to be um it
we were that wasn't the intention the the the humor came from the reality of these family dynamics and and not
uh pim found him at a very young age the youngest ever graduate of
and this incredible technology to be able to to shrink to uh half an inch tall
and he was a he became enthralled with it obsessed with it and wanted to pursue it and hank had decided to leave all that behind and he realized what a pandora's box the technology was so he shut him out
and and and hank is not the warmest father figure possible and um and really really broke
he has this idea that he needs to be this salesman and this larger than life
um and so he goes at it but he just he keeps falling
it's it's it's a really fun character to play because you have those that
real and present um which is a really great thing for the the cause my character is is very broad and and coming from a big place
is is very broad and and coming from a big place and every time i have a scene with him
at at penn tech and both have a similar
very judgmental and difficult father and and they share that and they share that that resentment and that
cause i've known him for like nine years and so it was it was it's just instantly fraternal you know when we get together we're gonna do this movie and we we had so much to draw on so it was
thing and it's uh super scripted and this was the opposite and he dustin called me and he said do you wanna do do you wanna play my brother in a film that carl bessai is directing whose work i love and i was like yes i didn't even think twice on the phone with him i'm like yes i'm doing this and it
it's just it's it's freedom it's freedom man you know like you get to you get to explore i sat down with my acting coach andrew andrew mcilroy and i said you know we we built all this backstory for these characters and all this like life you know we got to do all this cool stuff you don't get to do that a lot
exciting for me was that i i i've never done anything like this you know and i'm always about the next thing the next job the next challenge you know that i'd
you know it was incredibly gratifying to be able to you know reconnect with somebody that you
few uh that i had no connection with you know for for so many years so it was it's one of the i i look at it as one of the best one of the best experiences that that have come
i mean it was amazing it was amazing that that that that was happening do you know what i
you know and and eh i don't wanna i don't i don't ever wanna look back on my life and and have a history of like shutting doors on people do you know what i'm saying and and when someone comes to me you know you know rekindling a a relationship it's it's
you know i think when i figured out the evolution was figuring out that um parents are just people too you know parents are just people they make
i've lived a league of lives you know and um done so many things and seen so many
and i just i wanna do as much as i can i wanna push myself as far into as many characters as i can and do as many things as i can this is a challenge you know i mean that's what
so huge and it's it just it requires so much of that focus that i'm talking about that
i'm uh it never gets old it there's always another challenge there's always another uh thing to figure
i mean i'll i'll stay as long as they'll have me that's kinda my vision to it but i at the same time i don't write the scripts so i'm kinda curious to
people have always made a lot of assumptions you know you look you see this this uh young all american quarterback looking dude on the show and you just immediately make assumptions and i think people started really identifying me with those assumptions which is
uh the media and i understand that but at the same time i felt like i had to step in at some point and relate to people my experience and relate to
if i can through my experience shed light on the way out of a difficult situation that i'm i know many kids are experiencing you know just like i did when i was a teenager i mean it's that's
this whole fame thing is it just seems like so many opportunities i see it as so many opportunities and those there are many opportunities to do the next wrong thing
finding a place you know it for me it wasn't so much about you know the substances per se it was more about about not fitting in it was not
uh i i i hadn't found myself at all i had no idea who i was i had no idea where i was going i was trying to you know and all of a sudden i was like i'm gonna be i'm gonna be this bad kid and other kids are gonna be like oh he's the bad kid and so he's cool and so they'll wanna hang out with
from watching people around me you know and it was just a lack of not really having a self image at the time as which is that's like typical
like so what i'm trying to do now with this whole you know i had a hard time thing
and my evolution out of that came a little later you know nineteen twenty or so
find something that inspires you find something that you can get excited about and that will become your new
and now i i see i i i'm actually super critical i see all of my little mistakes
being self aware you know or somewhat self aware of some degree you you really know when you did well and when you
i took so much that from so much that was unsaid from from that experience that you know i i learned a lot it really made it a learning experience
i've been doing it since i was tiny and uh we we just came out of the studio we just recorded the drum parts and the guitar parts for three new songs so we're gonna be releasing them like singles we're gonna we're gonna shoot music videos for each of them and release them the
well first of all it was on vinyl cause i was digging through the cabinet you know there was all these old records when i was a kid and i was digging through the cabinet and there was these records and i just put it on and it was like i couldn't even believe
just so much luck involved in it everybody's just slinging the puck around everywhere and it's just you don't know what's gonna happen you know just the the finesse goes away
who i moved to british columbia bc victoria vancouver area when i was two so i grew up on the west coast uh and i moved to vancouver and that's when i started becoming a hockey fan and watching hockey all my friends watch it and stuff and and when i moved away from canada it was when i really started becoming a hockey fan because it's it's uh it's patriotism really when you
come to the states all of a sudden every canadian you run into you into them at the at the la kings game
but but they're i think a lot of a lot of my castmates are sorta new to it you know so but i'm i'm working on
all these new york songs and it's we're coming to nationals alright the big show choir competition which takes place in new york city so we've all got extra super coach tickets to new york and
yeah you know like the cheap flights from ohio and all the kids come to the
it seriously is you walk into rogers arena and it's like church it's it's there's something more than a hockey game going on
it's a whole different animal it's it's it's so exciting so exhilarating to go up on stage in front of you know we're gonna
i mean i i see i see how those kids are inspired you know when they come up and they wanna get the hat or the jersey autographed by you know kessler or somebody else and and uh the look in their face it's the same when they come up to me and so it it's there's a responsibility you know and uh it's it's an honor it's an honor for me to be in that
i think it's it's gonna be interesting to see uh whether or not glee wins nationals i think that's really gonna be interesting to see cause i think that's gonna set the tone for a lot of the
and who's gonna who's gonna be in the third season who's not you know who's gonna be around i mean it's gonna be interesting to see i
professionally i did nothing i mean i i i i was gonna do a movie and it didn't work out unfortunately um but i then i was kind of like i got all this time off awesome so i had three weeks off or i had i had four weeks off in total three weeks i went to vancouver and for a week i went to the caribbean
i was super excited to come back i didn't know what was gonna happen i didn't know if it was gonna be like crazy you know there was always rumors and all this drama and and then i came back to
just like i had never left so it was it was lovely to get back and i i think all of us had enough time off cause we were working super hard before the
just like i'd never left so it was it was lovely to get back and i i think all of us had enough time off cause we were working super hard before the break and we went away and and we all had enough time off to kind of recharge
so that we could put them into our glee flashlight and shine it at the world do you like that
you know there's that quality about finn that's just it's really it's easy to miss it's you miss you would miss that if if a relative was like that and then they they left you would miss
so finn's like my my cousin like my relative that goes away for summer
more kind of linear way of writing it feels like it's all about core characters rather than like you know in the second season we did a lot of you know uh uh tribute episodes things like that which were big and you know huge production numbers and stuff like that it feels like
shelley corcoran storyline which the i think is really interesting storyline that didn't get
so lots of new characters this season to but i think to expand the the central group it's it's not i don't think it's gonna be too divided it's
vanessa lengies who's also from toronto uh a friend of mine for years is playing sugar motta and yeah we go way back me we had a bunch of friends in
whenever you know somebody from canada and they come and they're on your show all of a sudden you're friends it's
and uh he's coming onto our show as well to play uh mercedes' new man
crazy fifties fashions and half of it one block was italian the other spanish
cause the men of course looked dressier than the women you know it's like a punk look but i didn't realize it was punk then but i was very
sailors and and and um and the guy that lived upstairs from me was um you know italian we were all italian families and um and the lady that took care
husband was a psychic so i just the visual was pretty intense it was always like you know the wall of saints and everyone would come to him
folk songs and and then when i left brooklyn
different world and one foot in where everyone else was and so i thought uh
is that alan gives a speech which is written you know mack the knife uh gives a speech at the end about
and so i wondered about that character and i realized that we
of when you know his wisdom didn't bring him too much fun you know her beauty didn't bring him too much fun and in the back of my head i'm thinking cause
and and i am so proud to be part of um a play like that because
this point in my life or at any point in my life i didn't have a
doing that one she said no and to actually be able to as a
and then we were with we had many versions of blue angel and then but it was mostly john torrey that i wanted to work with he had worked with a
girl who did very well her name was sandy and she was very well endowed and and she would stand you know proud and
in the back of the walls they would say you know are we not signed no we are
when we were first signed i had just dyed my hair i always remember from what hair color i had
and it was so exciting and we were on our way
it was big and and it was we were going we were going and the next year we were just gone we were not doing well we were at shitsville
and um i remember i just like spray painted my hair blue and i remember going on stage singing oh have a blue christmas
she's drunk and i'm thinking well not yet
because they wanted me to be a copy of someone else and um and i didn't i remember they took me out to work with georgio moroder and he wanted me to do this song roadie and sound like deborah harry
and thinking and i hope that it become such a classic that you never forget and
it was remarkable that it did become a hit song but it was
i tell you it was a life lesson for me because that song constantly
it was up for a grammy for best song it didn't win
i choose people that i knew that i really liked i mean i love sarah mclachlan
i used to hear on one radio station which is now been um it put
once you have it separate then that's where you start controlling people and their minds and their brains and how they think because everything is controlled
i was so excited to be able to do that and i was able to mix the r and b from vivian green on the alternative of
big times and i was talking to linda telling linda when i says you know i i laughed my ass off
at me and i said i i didn't wanna say anything i i acknowledged it and i thought in
yeah i was just sitting there and and uh so roy did all the stuff and and paul
insisting that you know it should be this way and i did say something and paul said um i wanted to hear it the way
it was the time at the racetracks when the young girls were coming in and
young girls everybody loved animals so that's why you were there whereas the other guys maybe they used to be this or they used to be that and they
well um i didn't dance well so i kept
i was a a background singer for like a show band and i would be doing these dance
and um they always incorporated i i would hear the
r and b and um and jazz and blues there's a fabulous record called
different kind of uh uh blues but the original blues stuff that caught my ear was more uh
i put my family and my friends in most of my videos and and i you know it was kind of like our gang after awhile and it
things with her but my my brother my mother my friends my boyfriend my you know
my mother twice you know you play with her when you're little and i got to play with her in the videos and she just you know i thought oh she could act you know and i was like a stage daughter after a while and i realized she told me
it's old country music like the almost the same time
so i uh i got to work with seymour stein who is a a legend and he
at a a a benefit and you know i was doing my own facial before the
talk anyway so we became friends and every time i went to nashville i would kinda text her
this producer tony brown who had worked with emmy and who he was
saw documentary nashville cats and you know the marshall scholes documentary and
you get these ideas you watch people and you write you know but when you become part of what's
get to do it eventually i'm now on sire i can i did a record that i kinda wanted to do a long time ago i sang with kd lang
but you know everything happens in time and it's a it was a wonderful record i got willie nelson alison krauss

the writing is so fantastic that there might be some some lines which you know get out there and like the line from the uh the pilot you know what's the point of having fuck you money if you never say fuck you and i think i think that went trended on twitter or wherever it was um so
you know if they keep writing great lines like that there's every possibility that there'll be these water color moments but uh i think the way in which paul and myself will be sort of coming down the same track in opposing directions waiting for this this big collision
just sort of trying to outmaneuver one another uh hopefully it'll throw out some interesting
well i think it it he i think he has a bit of survivor guilt and i think he it informs the way in which he wants to put back
sets up this these scholarship funds which we see in the pilot um and i think he's sincere about that he takes all that very seriously i think the mystery is why bobby was
in the tower on the day um and i'm not suggesting for a second that it's bobby axelrod the terrorist i don't think he was involved in that but i think he might have been involved
the guys that i met only in that he is an elevated heightened character i think
is a little bit of a rock star i think as much as he says uh as shrewd as he is and as
years which i found all of them to be i
so i think he has to be careful about that and it might be that sense of ego in
little bit of a show off that he'll have to watch he'll have to guard against
people talk about the parenting scene quite a lot and it's interesting i cause no one has said whether they
it's warm and affectionate and good parenting or whether
a little overbearing competitive setting the two kids off against one another you know parenting in that
i think the way i found the scene when i first saw it when i when we played it was that it was both but it was very
parenting from a father who had grown up i think in simpler
was driving his kids driving his kids which i have seen a lot actually from growing up from parents that that kind of father who
close to his sons and daughters but there's a sort of toughness there there's a you you you learn the facts i will grill you on them you will get them right because this will help you and it's all done with great affection great warmth a playfulness albeit that ends up in doing ten pushups if you get the answer wrong but it's uh there's a sort of it's their version
of warmth and playfulness but underlying that is serious message that
which is a which is an innately competitive ambitious streak that just isn't bobby
i yeah i i think there are people who who do still think i'm american um and uh i the first american thing i did was um band of brothers and then um and i i still get people uh
four of five for this thing and then suddenly i was whisked off to la and i was stuck in front of tom hanks and steven spielberg
and they said stephen would like to see you at nine o'clock so i had like four showers about sixteen cups of coffee and i went in slightly sort of shaking and uh thought well i've blown this but they they gave me the role and it was it they're they're true true
and i was in la at the time i invited him and he said i can't come he gave me a two dollar bill which is one of his
advocacy you advocate for your character and you you believe in trust and uh love your character and can defend them whatever they are going to do even if it seems like they might be putting on a
so the american marine who uh starts worshipping allah and turns to islam uh obviously is uh going to be in the context of a thriller a
before i even accepted the job that i'd feel uneasy if there was any um any lazy uh associations drawn between violence and islam and wouldn't it be more subversive if if actually islam
eh well yes it it is a big hit and then it became an even bigger hit when the uh president of the united states said
was expecting to be sat next to the toilets and i ended up being at his table
and uh found myself asking him and and mr cameron who was sitting next to him
have you seen the show and uh and uh our prime minister went uh no i uh well it's um you know we're we're only on the first season at home we're only on episode two and um
but in their bedroom upstairs they were putting on like darling could you fix the tie and just
watch it and he said aren't aren't you supposed to be running the free world uh and he and he and he said well uh on saturday afternoons michelle she takes the two girls they go play tennis i go into the oval office i pretend i'm gonna work and i switch
box set of homeland um uh apparently the president wanted a signed box set of homeland and the team
keen to support obama and i said could you just sign this and claire danes had written something really lovely and sweet saying i was a fan of yours long before you were a fan of ours i thought god that's really stylish and i thought god think of something great and funny
i was i was in writing emails for the whole of the next week going i do hope he
where when you die you you don't know you're dead uh it's sorta like bruce willis in the sixth sense and your journey
revelation that you have died and once you come to the revelation that you have died
and it's this enormously challenging and frustrating and you guys uh for those of you who watched lost were on this journey with us as writers is what am i working towards
you know locke was in a wheelchair hurley was a lottery winner um because these people chose not to
made it up as as you went along how how much of the show is planned out um and they want the answer to to that question to be we weren't making it up as we went along we totally had a
the plan was rock solid we had we had a a binder of
except except it wasn't women it was a plan and uh
this was this was this was our intensive mythology and that's what we're
from its inception you know very early on for the reasons that i talked about before that we knew we were gonna run out of
it's a mystery based show and so if you have a mystery based show and it's an episode of
contained and you move on but for lost it was serialized so we we knew that these mysteries needed to have solutions um so we actively started lobbying for an end date of the show then right at the same time that we got our end date within the within the space of about three weeks the
sopranos ending we started hearing all this negativity surrounding the sopranos ending from the fan base which is like
what does it mean did tony get shot et cetera it's like you asking those questions defeats the entire purpose of the way that david chase chose to end it
then we came to the secondary revelation which was there was no ending that we could possibly come up with that was not gonna be highly divisive and once we embraced that idea
and in our fan community you were sort of either a star wars guy or a star trek guy or i'm saying guy and i mean guys and girls but you know you kinda had to pick one but what we what we started to find was that there were a lot of people who define
and in anticipation of this happening any even my reps didn't know
let let that be this and sure enough uh the script that i read was by this guy jon spaihts who i i shared a credit with on prometheus
at the center of it which was where do i come from who made me
explore these ideas of um of who made me and why and more importantly what would we say to them
i was terrified and remain terrified of him to this day uh
um it it can be very ambiguous uh but i choose to look at it as i just want to write up to my audience and i feel like i'm not interested in spelling things out for them i want to leave avenues of imagination that are available to them but i don't want to say
things out for them i want to leave avenues of imagination that are available to them but i don't want to say that
there is um in the storytelling that i do a defined um you know uh
here from the viewers at home uh and then obviously we're gonna field questions here live uh at the amc
again uh via twitter he asks how does the greek myth of prometheus tie into the story uh beyond just giving the ship its
the the myth of prometheus is uh prometheus was a titan in greek mythology uh and uh
mankind mankind was sort of uh wandering around on the earth very cold and not able to
food so prometheus stole fire from the gods gave it to man and as we all know man has done all sorts of wonderful things with fire but all sorts of nasty things as well the gods got angry at prometheus they tied him to a rock uh and and so every day his liver gets pecked out by an
until it's a bit completely gone then it regenerates and then another eagle comes repeats the process and we said hey who
this this one's from uh jim mojelesky sorry if i mispronounced your name jim also on facebook uh we saw guy pierce appearing as peter wayland in the ted piece do the ideas he presents in that piece
last summer uh where you said that with prometheus you wanted to scare the s star star t out of
i think we all know what she's talking about guys right uh is this the scariest movie you've ever made and uh and and what makes it so
how did it transition from an alien prequel into what you've called an original mythology
a gentleman named john spaihts uh wrote a uh wrote a script that i thought was great and ridley uh said was great and sent sent to me
and uh but ridley said i really want to uh make an original movie i feel like i already made
um and uh and i'm very happy with the way that turned out there's no reason for me to just go back and do that again uh there's some great ideas in this script uh is there a way that we can take these ideas and move forwards
uh at the same time giving a tip of the cap to the people who have seen alien we don't wanna deny it this is a part of that but it has to be a movie unto itself
i just sort of looked at you with stars in my eyes and said whatever you want me to
mm mhm mhm
that time with the gang
like uh you guys are the ones who waited in line in the rain to come and talk to us so uh uh we'd love to hear some questions from
so please feel free to um uh approach the mics and
where the interviewer asks the question presupposing that we will just answer it as if you you hadn't taken a massive
the life that you have seen in different movies perhaps that's additive uh perhaps it's going in its own new way perhaps it's both but hopefully you will get the sort of uh
that you are having and what's really interesting uh to us when we started talking about the future is say a hundred years from now or in in this case in in twenty eighty five uh are people still gonna be having the same
or will science have gone to a place where those the that conversation is radically changed and what are the religious and spiritual implications of that so what we're willing to say is
your question is dealt with and talked about with great significance in the movie but we don't wanna tell you what the answer to it is um or whether or not the characters are still asking it at the
any scientific discovery that could be made in my lifetime that would make me stop believing in
and you know if we did our jobs right hopefully you'll be asking yourself is there any scientific discovery that could be made in my lifetime that would make me stop believing in god uh it's a very provocative question and we certainly don't have the answer to it but the movie is certainly
we had a miniaturization uh bit a machine that um that basically shrunk things to infinitesimal size uh there
you know uh tomorrowland um uh a ride where the audience basically got
and our idea always and and there are some there's a great book called before tomorrowland that jeff jensen who worked on the story with brad and i wrote that talks a little bit more
actually a cover for the real place so yes walt was was most
i i can't wait i'm uh because jj and i are close um everyone has this
or know things about the movie that they don't and the and the god's honest truth is i don't wanna know anything um so when i saw that trailer i experienced it in the same way and at the same time as everyone else did and it
who who is that chrome stormtrooper and like i don't know anything and it's immensely
of of course i uh right now i'm working on the second season of the uh uh of this tv show that i've been working on called the leftovers i don't have any i don't have any movies in the pipeline because
um these two jobs has has been um immensely time consuming but um obviously the uh you know star wars really made me wanna be a filmmaker so the the uh the the possibility that i could work on one of those films in the future would be a
a plane and i cried you know it got me i'm not gonna you know i'm i'm a softy when it comes to that kind of stuff i thought it
unfortunately after after trek two uh i went to go work on tomorrowland and uh and the leftovers and so and then jj went to go do star wars so um star
its own propulsion and i actually kind of feel like um uh that those movies are best served by some level of of constant reinvention i was very excited to learn that simon um who is a a huge fan himself was gonna start uh working on the writing of the uh of the third film and i can't wait to see what he cooks up because i i feel
uh uh i i honestly again i don't know i much about it other than that this this star trek film is really about the beginning of the of the five year mission so um it's it's establishing
you know i i do feel like um that perhaps uh although i really love into darkness and and working on it um the idea of bringing star trek back into that kind of optimistic more fun adventure space um as opposed to needing to necessarily make it dark and broody um i i would like to see um a little bit more of that original um series kind of colorful energy uh back
and one can only think about the star wars system and the fact that there we had a satellite mounted canon well they'd be good for shooting down rock
but um you know biological way like we dissect frogs um maybe
benevolent species coming to this planet and taking a man and a woman and taking ova out of a women and
to speak for mankind to these beings that were were coming
key cases shermer benny and uh barney and betty hill the pascagoula incident um um travis walton
from the space i would have to say look you know what we see up there and what we find you know
well i wouldn't wanna go back in time and change anything because uh that would be
a tampering that i i wouldn't serve mankind well although there are many horrors of course wouldn't you have loved to have
problem and then world war two may not have well look there were two guys there was otto dinkle you ever heard of him well he was an orator
maybe otto dinkle would've been the guy that would've gone on with this rabid antisemitism and wiped out nine million people
things but you don't want to go back in time and play with
today and the improvements we've made uh in in in uh in human rights and in regarding ourselves uh as sacred they've come because of the bad
i'd love to sit with the you know the like uh you know the quantum physics guys because there really is is the root of
and the the the just the the the joy of these studies and
what i said and what you said and what we we all did two minutes ago still exists
uh that uh you know there there may be beings out there who
in a vessel or is there some cost that that you pay
i mean we know people have been taken we know there's experimentation going on we know people have been told about agendas what we now have to do is use that
as a motivation to socially transform this planet to a more peaceful more loving more tolerant state so his movement the the movement for social
bassett who uh has the the ufo time clock and then grier both bassett and grier
and uh i was outside and britney spears called me because she wanted to me to appear on saturday night live with her and so i picked i was outside having a cigarette the phone rang uh i i hello britney
me off or that wanted to give me verification that i was on the right track i don't know but i do know i i
um i i i don't know the tapes exist i have them we're gonna try to repackage them we might put them
well there's some media that are that are guilty of of trying to suppress and and and there are some media that are just
well yeah the uh the last ufo symposium conducted by mufon and they sent me the book of the speakers there were there were many many
when i talk to people well first of all people ask me about it they they come to me and they say oh uh you know we we saw an interview we heard an interview uh
cnn they've seen fox they've seen the daily news they come to me and ask me about it and i basically lay
i'm sitting here in our blues palace at sunset and olive in west hollywood california
and um compelled to contemplate the last thirty years of my life i do go
lombard street in toronto and it was a snowy blustery wintery
silhouetted against a uh a toronto evening sky at around midnight with a blizzard around him well we fell in love of course as you
in fact formed the blues brothers because we were listening to downchild
i said well uh you're from chicago you surely know about these blues artists he said oh yes i do
i'm a grand funk devotee and zep devotee so i said well we can teach each other
um we will help you out by letting you and john join us on stage at the lone star cafe with the suits the briefcase the harmonica and we sang five songs with willie nelson
uh there would be no blues brothers they were the true blues brothers shaffer malone marini cropper dunn
musicians actual musicians john and i were actors we
and the devotion and the understanding of cropper dunn marini malone
and uh we're so grateful that he joined us as a blues brother by
he uh relaxed me he made me into a less of a robot
he would've wanted and that's what he was all about great times great music good friends and the
and contributive profession the greatest export we can send to the world the blues brothers in any form in any
mates i can't be with you tonight i have obligations uh here in
thanks for what you're doing for john's legacy and memory and to
farmhouse was was where we had seances and and entities would come
we had an uh one uh just after i was born she was nursing me uh upstairs in the farmhouse and she kind of woke up and saw
bureaucratess so if she told me that story you know it's true
but um my dna is uh is is plugged into the right place when i'm here uh it's like an electric razor you
give my fellow countrymen i don't know the accent in my hometown just the simplicity the people
and uh also i guess what i tried to do was uh was keep john's legacy and uh and the
we we we like that yeah uh it's true jimmy can sound like john and peter can sound like me yeah yeah
uh back and forth never did i ever think you know coming from hull quebec that that james brown would be one of my best
priesthood but uh let me tell you i met some great guys met some great
i i went to a uh uh an analyst uh when i was a kid and uh i have a little touch of that a little touch of tourette's was
some of the uh uh just uh maybe just getting absorbed in kind of a a look a face a voice when i was a kid you know in the mirror like jim carrey talks about
i grew up within a public school with arts programs you know kinda like that show glee
so that uh arts is not the dessert it's part of the main
but we have a very inventive chairman of the nea rocco landesman
um well it's it's it's set in the seventies it's directed by brooks branch and you know i grew up in the seventies and i love those movies like paul mazursky movies where it's got drama comedy it's just like life like unmarried woman so that's why i wanna do it's
you take it very personally that's really kind of devastating but i'm at the point in my career it's like alright what's next i i don't take anything for
well okay uh several things i don't like to repeat
so sometimes it's a role that i've already done so i don't wanna play that
things that i don't wanna do that but mostly you know you do the best you can at the time and hopefully it all works out in the end
in bed and you go what did i do definitely i'm a i'm human but like desperate housewives for instance i turned that out originally which everybody knows
kept keeping it alive which they should not have done that they were
i i turned it down because i had just done a show called pasadena that mike white wrote that i loved i thought it was great
and then i was lucky that three years into the show he called me up and he said are you ready to come on now and that's really unusual in hollywood most times when you turn someone down here they say screw you i'm never working with
that you need to really communicate why you're doing it i didn't know that early on and um i i really have had directors come up to me and say
it was a bonus of not being the show originally the the four leads are so iconic now that i think mark is very careful not to mess with that you know who they are as characters whereas i'm the wild
you know killing my husband the first season and being a battered wife to then being becoming a stalker and and then i ended up
in vietnam that i was portraying and it was the first time that i saw
have to move to new york and they don't pay very much money it's on hbo and i said
other roles i've turned down that i've stopped talking about cause people constantly ask me
um so my dream was that she would come back from paris with a phony french accent and being really
unfortunately that's not how mark cherry wanted to end the show and it's his show and he gets to do what he wants i just was
me because when i was growing up she was the epitome of the working woman um in fact when i was younger she had her own
called lois lane and she had own her comic and that was one of my favorites and
the longest running lois lane voice other people have come and
nathan and i have worked together three times um he was my priest slash lover in a show i did called pasadena
and then he was my husband on housewives and then i he asked me to come on castle as a favor to
it's a game where you have to guess who's a town's person
is played by joanna cassidy who i adore as a person and joanna and i have talked about
six i was supposed to be marrying mike that's what i thought was gonna happen and then marc called me marc cherry who created the show called me a week before we started shooting and said i should
i was had this story line with julie benz you know where she was my lesbian girlfriend
she needs to stop trying to find happiness outside herself that the happiness is inside
i don't wanna get in the way of you having your own show that would be terrible so if it doesn't work out you can come back so in one day he wrote uh robin and katherine go to
and it happened so quickly that i didn't have time to digest it and i was crying in the makeup trailer and everybody was weeping because it was like
and i said uh what i'm becoming a man and they said close and that was it and i was so excited i actually was in the parking lot and i started jumping up and down screaming because
we there's been so many wild things to happen on wisteria lane but none of the housewives got to be lesbians so i got to
and i think that it made mark a little bit nervous that i was having my own storyline cause my job was to cause trouble for the other housewives so he didn't want it to go on too long it was more about how they would react to having one of their
live and um we actually had worked together years before and
other actors because there's so many different outlets so i think when they see an actor's working they wanna
no it might yeah no if body of proof doesn't work out marc said that i when when that got picked up um he sent me a big bouquet of flowers with a note saying i'll be waiting
it's more like house where you know my character's kind of smarter than everyone else and arrogant and
and then each week i play a medical examiner and each week uh we'll solve the crime of how the body
really good cast uh we have two cops uh nick bishop is an australian
things and then we have the pathologists in the medical crime lab
uh i was just so shocked because you you see stuff on the
to certain things um i'm not the obvious candidate to go and do something like this but um i care about people a lot
to try and make a difference and try and get different people to maybe pick up the phone and donate or do something relief i know that most of my fans are so
into you mop especially you know somebody that you would never expect to just donate would actually maybe go oh that's touched me so uh that was the point for me to go out there as me and
ebola here and uh you know this slum this marbella slum it's so compact that you know anything that's any disease that hits that area is just gonna spread and
into these treatment centers and they're never coming back so that was the rumors going around about
ebola from from fluids so you'll be wiping your mom's face and her tears and that's how you catch
and i asked him i said what do what do you wanna do well and he said i just wanna go to school just want to go to school and i was like wow you know like i can't get my kids out of bed and like this kid and i said what do you wanna do he wants well i wanna be a lawyer and i was just so touched by the fact that you know they just it's it's it's not a life it's barely an existence and i think every human being on this planet deserves to eat and drink it's such a simple
him bits of rubber so that he can fill this big bag up so hopefully so that he can get a dollar so that he can eat some rice that's that's what his diet consists of and you
how have we let this happen and and the powers that be who
you know you they call them lions out there because they're more dangerous than lions because basically what they do is just they'll come and they'll bite the babies when they're asleep and of course again they don't know they don't quite understand that babies got a bit of a
a fiver two mosquito nets right a medically treated mosquito net stops them getting bitten you can't prevent that any other way so they'll they'll they might survive and then they'll come out and then they'll get bit again and then
children on these videos which is why i urge you please to watch because i know the relief it's a beautiful thing it's got some quite lighthearted things throughout the night really but what we're
throughout the night really but what we're doing it for is for these films and you have to stick with the films i've been guilty of turning over i'll hold my hands up never again you've got to stick it out you've got to watch these
positivity cause we're gonna raise lots of money and i just uh you know uh you sign up support relief dot com do whatever you want to do anything anything walk run cycle swim
so just uh donate please because it's such an important thing that we look after each other as human beings
alright i remember i've been out before i think i was filming something and there was two cockneys
you know and it's hard work it's heart nothing but heartbreak but the idea of another club coming to your little town
you know and uh so i've got a bit little tiny i mean who's off base it then but
uh it's all part of the buzz about walking with your holding your dad's hand as a boy and walking to that ground and smelling hot dogs and burgers and you know just
and helen chimed in present i mean it was just a it was a moment of running i just remember the first moment
set him up for a lovely little goal which he scored and and it was all televised and i i remember i was
thing to have that opportunity to have that opportunity was just the best thing
um but he was excited on the pit and he was excited off it and he was actually
to have a a a sort of drama club i used to go to and then i had an audition within a week and i got that part
and then all of the sudden now i'm i'm working professionally as an actor but i'm still a kid from the council estate and
and it's something i've took me a long i mean so i started acting at fourteen so i mean i'm thirty five now and it's
you get a niche in the market okay so you make a movie that's very successful and so as much as you want to be versatile and
work don't just fall back and go oh okay this has put him on the
all that means and listen i've like i said i feel blessed all i'm trying to do really is feed my kids and i've had a great career and i'm passionate
uh he he he want he he he's he's a he's a quite a straight goer nick but he's obsessed with men and um
well look he's been great for me you know i've made four movies with him and uh and arguably uh the most success i've had have been with his movies
completely just dropped me out of it so he's almost gone down that route of going you know what i don't really wanna tie myself with danny anymore
he doesn't want anything to do with me and bless him he's put plan b in a role that i i should be playing the swing of ray winstone i don't care okay i
it's a different thing cause it's a comedy and it's slapstick and it's a farce which you know is is i'm not known for doing i don't think it's gonna
praying that i was dead that i was trending please tell me danny is trending because he's died and i felt
listen i don't want to get on this whole whine about feeling sorry for me self because i've had a great life i'm happy
he's uh the brother of uh shirley played by linda henry um and uh he's come in with his family and one of the reasons why i wanted to do it is because he's a family man he's not a gangster if it was gonna be obvious i come in run about with shotgun
where you know with this i come in and i'm an alpha male but i love me family and very protective of them and um you know i just thought i should i do something a bit shit for once
realize actually you know i mean i've had a bit of fame for a while but since i've been in east end it's gone to another level when i think um this whole scene i had with my son and he's coming out stuff you know it was at a real positive thing
uh you know a lot of young gay men who hadn't come out yet they saw that scene and i was getting letters from you know from these guys saying that they came out the next day because of it and i think that's a powerful thing you know and i was really proud to
think uh you know what i'm about that i was gonna have you know react badly and uh instead i just cuddled in and said listen boy it's fine i love you no problem it's that woman
don't get involved do you but me oldest is nearly eighteen got a six year old daughter but i got me little
yeah it's hard work to be fair but you know what i think i've rung the bell he's a good kid and that you know uh
uh it it's just it's just strange seeing them grow up and uh
that was enough for a got more counts stage do a play and of course it's just
it to happen i needed something to happen and all of a sudden i thought wow sort your life out lively you know i'd a great opportunity i was a very lucky actor to be working with such people and i nearly blew it just cause i
that was the worst thing for me cause i was on stage and uh it was called celebration the play and i come on and it's all set in a
screams he screams when he sees it so it might frighten him off and then the alien went
and uh we believe we have him uh dead to rights uh
and uh craigen gives us a couple days off and we all go our separate
a difficult situation in that we all have those two days off and don't expect to hear from one another so to everybody in the squad it's just normal that we wouldn't hear even partners wouldn't even necessarily call each other
most raw episodes i've read um hard to read i'm sure it'll be hard to watch
um but it's also a story of survival it's a
mostly for liv but for the team try and hunt hunt her down
olivia's situation is about as dire as any situation can be knowing what we know about louis and what he's capable of and what his mo is
you know the svu team we all know that lewis is responsible for multiple rapes uh for at least one murder uh for uh being responsible for the death of an older woman uh
and his hostage that only you know makes that situation more difficult more
i don't think i've ever read a script faster you know what is gonna happen you're just flipping the pages to
uh has been uh granted leave from the squad
she comes back in the middle of an investigation that deals with multiple
uh and people take shots at munch and then of course munch takes his shots at everyone else uh
uh warren leight and julie martin the the writers uh were channeling richard belzer when they wrote it you know uh but everybody takes their shot uh but it's it's all it's a bittersweet
uh so he is not retiring as a police officer but he is retiring from
and we'll get to work together again but you know i have a lot of fond memories of working with belzer uh obviously i
shed light on what it would be like to be a an svu
it'll be interesting without much there to see whether amaro gets a little run
but you know personally i i'm i'm a big richard belzer fan he's a very funny man he's uh genuine he's heartfelt he's thoughtful uh you know he's a comedian he's
in this episode you have uh the munch storyline which
very personal to all of us uh and then you have the the crime and the crime centers around
sometimes remote locations uh odd locations uh and it's it's difficult to get an invite everything is cash based so it's hard to trace who was at the party uh and because of that it's it's difficult to find who our
cause uh liv gets a text from uh a
uh who is who has moved on and now claims to have been uh assaulted again and so that's that's how the investigation begins and we start
uh warren leight and julie martin the the writers uh were channeling richard belzer when they wrote it you know uh but everybody takes their shot uh but it's it's all it's a
munch is being he's he's uh retiring from svu
the uh ada's office to the da's office to be a an investigator for the
uh so he is not retiring as a police officer but he is retiring from svu
so hopefully that has potential to bring him back within the circle uh and we'll get to work together again but you know i have a lot of fond memories of working with belzer uh obviously i'd i'd only joined the show uh
relative time that's a short amount of time when you think about the show being on for fifteen seasons um
and yet i still have very good memories of of working with him i
shed light on what it would be like to be a an svu
it'll be interesting without munch there to see whether amaro gets a little
but you know personally i'm i'm a big richard belzer fan he's a very funny man he's uh genuine he's heartfelt he's thoughtful uh
in this episode you have uh the mensch story line
very personal to all of us uh and then you have the the crime and the crime centers around
sometimes remote locations uh odd locations uh and it's it's difficult to get an invite everything is cash based so it's hard to trace who was at the party um and because of that it's it's difficult to find who our
but it does carry a weight to it because of of what is currently happening within the squad room with much as
not necessarily study but to it's an interesting presentation as to how cops can have different instincts can have different perception of of a victim or of a crime and how they investigate that crime
it centers around an investigation uh of a serial rapist murderer and uh it takes us down to miami to extradite him back to new york and being from miami uh i was excited to read that in the script uh less excited to have uh shot in the bronx
so we we go down there and uh on our way down we meet uh the character played by marcia gay harden who is uh an fbi agent who beat us to the punch essentially and is there uh on the federal level to uh
for this for this one person and then uh at that point we come back to new york and we realize that it's not as a straight a shot as we thought the case would be it gets more complicated uh it gets more personal it gets more
lewis uh played by marcia gay harden they have a personal
there's a conflict there uh so amaro plays the cattle
it's a twenty five year old uh essentially cold case uh there are uh four victims uh raped and murdered and a fifth
uh that is questionable too in new york which which uh brings it under our umbrella at svu and so we take ownership of the case because we have positive uh dna on one of the cases and we're trying to uh
uh a status uh where she's the fed and we're the lowly nypd svu
relationship with liv with benson amaro i think sometimes uh throughout the course of the episode it feels like he doesn't want to disturb that and so he treads lightly
this is my first time working with marsha i mean marsha and i have so much in common she's uh we both went to nyu graduate school uh she has an academy
she's a fantastic actor i mean you can't really say enough about marcia gay harden i mean she comes to
you know that started in july and here we are you know approaching february
uh helps us because you know we're we're in the trenches for for months on end uh telling story after story and so to keep it fresh to have that walk in
i think opens things up a lot so i yeah i was excited that she was gonna be a part of it just because of her name but to get to know her and to
jake carnes and i we i think we have the the natural trifecta uh because we work together he actually interrogated me on the shield alright i was on the other side of the table and then on cold case i interrogated
cause i get to interrogate him again so that's three shows that we've uh worked on
he's a fantastic guy from the first moment i met him on the shield
you know that was that was his playground you know he had been on the the show for a season and i was coming in as a guest star uh with a
close relationship with liv with benson amaro i think sometimes uh throughout the course of the episode feels like he doesn't want to disturb
things are absolutely excellent it's always a good time when you're in toronto i don't know what it is it's like my fourth time in the city it's beautiful it's always nice people
i think for anybody um that has kind of had their sights on uh whatever goal forever for for however long um
you know i think it's cool that that's even part of a dialogue you know something that is so culturally relevant that can reach a guy like glenn beck i
like let's piss off glenn beck i mean that's just gonna happen like you know whether you want to or not so um i don't know
is that they're trying to sort of normalize things and this isn't necessarily exclusive to
uh equal rights this is about you know uh freedom
um but uh uh what were we saying oh yeah so i think you know glee kind of uh seeks to normalize things so it becomes less about a policy and more about a concept that just becomes um sort of matter of fact i think my favorite thing about the relationship that i get to have on the show uh as blaine with with kurt is
to have gravitated towards their relationship not so much because it is a young gay relationship so much as because it is a really
huge fan of kristen i told her this almost every day on set um i mean it's hard not to be a fan of hers i mean it's tough to be a funny woman i mean comedy is a man's game you know and especially in the entertainment world it's it's tough
just knocked it out of the park with everything she's funny she's she's pretty she's just fun and just uh magnetic in every kind of way which is why the comedy worked because you care about her so um yeah it's a real treat you get to i get to work with ilana
i don't know how i got that i'm sorry to to uh veer this off uh pink was scheduled to sing for this and she uh unfortunately
yeah and it's it's not even necessarily broadway songs but just people that have a lot of broadway ties cause there's a lot of um i'm sure a lot of people are singing you know pop songs
necessarily like all show tunes but yeah in that sense it is sort of like outdoor warped tour kind of vibe i mean we're not gonna be mosh pitting i mean
festivals and concerts and stuff and uh it just seemed like an interesting thing to try out because i you know i go to a lot of festivals and i got to a lot of
yeah it it could crash and burn for all i know i mean i don't wanna i don't wanna like jinx it but you know i'm we're it's
uh like plays and stuff and i was a big music fan i like a lot of
back on and i go wow that was pretty cool for you know like an eight year old but i i just bought a lot of records i bought a lot of tapes and i just i was just an avid rampant music consumer so i never really put the two
see her as a child because like just like i played basketball as a child but i'm not i'm not in the nba like i was it was
be like whoa very intimidating and uh that was not us we were the kids in the corner like reading chekhov and smoking
and so uh yeah i think my senior year of college we um for fun and if you and you know uh i think this happens a lot in colleges and universities put people put on these shows just for
that's the other one doesn't sound as good with poops but for poops and giggles and um you know i had music in it that i would write and because i wrote the songs i would sing them too so that was this thing called a very potter
i yeah i think for the for people to associate me with musical theater cause it's the thing that i say is um it like i i love food i've always loved food in restaurants but i never wanted to be like a chef so it's this kinda weird thing
listen if you're gonna like subject yourself to a life of being an i'm using quote fingers an artist uh in a batman voice an artist
a huge amount of uncertainty so for me i'm just a mercenary it was like if i could do music cool if i could be an actor cool if i'm in like a you know talk on the there's so many things that if it involved being creative cool
so i was years old and uh i remember realizing so i grew up in san francisco and robin williams was a big and has been for for obviously for many people many generations a big figure in the entertainment community and because his kids lived you know he raised his family in san
you know when you're years old you don't really have a
have any other ideas and then i remember seeing aladdin and then loving the
that's cool like however and i just remember like the audience thinking like laughing and but without ever comprehending and i thought it was so cool that all these strangers could come together and like get
and uh aside aside from the fact that it's it's such a great show and a and a hit show at that um i think the most exciting part about it is the the role itself you know i mean that's just a bonus that it's actually a
and interesting role for an actor's dream you know so um and and uh
my exact response i mean i was i was laughing basically because i i'm so busy with so many
um when my manager and my agent called me to tell me about this i thought they were sorta just messing with me because we have that kinda relationship where they would say something like this to mess with my
anything up because it's been a a dream come true and it's um i i i can't
it won't even hit me i don't think it's every really gonna hit me i hope it never does cause then i'd i'll
this before in other roles and in other capacities but this is the first one where it was a part that
positive energy for any kind youth dealing with with any kind of um issue so yes i i really
uh a friend and a mentor to kurt and and for the first time having somebody of
in the exact same situation as kurt uh to this at this point in the show most of kurt's
relatable as as blaine will be so that's the coolest part and uh we'll see what happens from there but uh
and it was introduced on a new technical standard a six two five lines as against four
um and one of the ideas i had uh was that we should put together all the loveliest things
western civilization it created in since the last two thousand years and and and show them in color a ravishing and a ravishing
it was a huge success uh beyond anybody's
said implicitly to viewers now look here you are we're gonna take this seriously we're gonna start at the
um well it was a huge success as i said so much so that the head of science or rather head of
oh uh quite soon after civilization had started saying this is an absolute scandal i was supposed to be he said you're supposed to be a
though science to start with was not at all as obvious a subject as civilization had been i mean for a
that it uh it didn't deal with with material objects in that sort of sense it dealt with theory and there were great slabs of theory how are you gonna put those across i mean that not an obvious
married at the time in britain he also had an an established
in british dramas period dramas costume dramas um and he's a marvelous broadcaster
they were bringing the americans which we were quite happy to do um and two that it gave us more time to think about the
um and and bruno was one of the big stars um of the brains trust i don't think anybody knew what he
maybe that's as well because he uh at first sight he was uh i mean he was very a very short man but he
burning eyes and burning conviction and he talked with a burning passion and intensity which which had
who decided that in order to bring some kind of coherence into science which is after all one way of looking at the
that he would look at it historically and saw how human beings and the human mind and human thought moved into
uh approaching towards the essentials of reality
uh working out the laws of nature he saw that as a historical
but there was another thing about bruno and that is that not only was he a a a remarkable historian of science and practicing scientist
he had uh a grasp of narrative
uh uh rather complicated movements uh in which he would
as though he was desperately trying to find this one word out of the whole
um now i suppose if you started to think about that he would you would start with gusto wouldn't you something that had that kinda symmetry left handed and
an average documentary uh takes about three months to do from beginning to end
um about one day at the cup final or something which obviously doesn't take that time but if you're going to take a considered subject three months is not unreasonable and if you're going to do a series of
uh a sentimental which was on the air which was i think probably just as well because it was um a very
concept to get hold of involved a lot of research even for bruno
and probably a a a greater achievement in that that that the problem of
uh and i think what he meant was that it was an affirmation about
um it was an affirmation of standards of scientific
uh is paramount uh a paramount quality in civilization
he didn't need a lot of persuasion because he knew i'm sure that he had it in him
uh and yet we will be able to deploy all the complicated technology
for three d it has big animals uh doing big thing
huge three ton elephant seal bulls that are fighting one another it has
it's a wonderful pace and uh so it has a sense of pace it has it has a sense of drama
i i hoped it was it was all the things i hope for uh and these
great depths great numbers of them manage to provide you with a good
and penguins wandering amongst elephant seals so that you suddenly get the foreground of this immense creature looming up onto you i thought it would be great three d and the
thousands upon thousands indeed hundreds of thousands of animals
a breeding place for a whole number of species that's why there's
of turning uh wild animals into human beings and pretending that they have um love stories or
human like names and so on that's not my style uh and
uh a three d film for big audiences and and
we have ended up producing is something that is at the same time zoologically absolutely
uh but it doesn't personalize but it nonetheless tells the story through the eyes of a single penguin and we haven't distorted
after all as we all know don't fly so and on land they're out of their element and they're not very agile so you can
story inevitably if if you're doing a story of this kind it in has to involve a
the end is producing an egg and so on um and you're able to do that as as a distillation of the true thing
one particular penguin as an example but of course we are able to use different ones
things will go for for a little for she's quite
the the king penguins have to feed they have to go out to sea so they they leave their
looking after them and they can't be everywhere and the and and the the giant come in
and elbow their way through like bruisers that they are and it's very dramatic
you know birds in dinner jackets standing around um um um um that's true but it's only for a small part of their lives most of their lives what they're most
um and their feet are at the end of the body which is why they have to stand vertically
and he's got his adult feathers so he's therefore waterproof as it were and able to go to
becomes sexually mature over a period of two or three years uh and then in some miraculous way which we only we are beginning to understand actually we know that bird navigation now depends like most animal navigation
uh so our character our king our
and we pick him up at the moment when he is ready to breed and he's gotta get back to the island where
uh was was hatched and he's gotta find himself a mate and he's gotta rear his chick
just go to all the lovely places see all the lovely things the things that fascinate you i mean the time you have tired of watching a bird of paradise display or seeing ten thousand flamingos
now the carrion crow's a a tough bird but it can't crack walnuts
and john said um i'd originally written it for chimps and john said i think there's a chance we could get get
get close so after about three or four days of crawling around in rwanda amongst these giant stinging nettles and mud and celery and oh terrible terrible time anyway we eventually got close to these gorillas and you could hear them i mean there they were and that we i came round and they were just up there and john said
and give us the stuff about the opposable thumb and forefinger and i said
well yeah i know we had all this marvelous material and he said well i i didn't really
experience i mean i've never experienced anything like it and i will never experience it again and the reason is
gorillas well gorillas and chimpanzees are so alike well i said all that in the film but they are alike as in you actually really felt that you're
dogs yes but somehow the whole business of being a kind of prime
you it's uh just an unforgettable moment of my life which i will never forget i'm not being
what a huge they're a marvelous thing to be able to turn on to a television they're in between all these road
and advertisements and nonsenses
this is what i do is i i don't look at animals cause i think oh yes i should be
oh absolutely of course i mean that's why people are scientists because they are enthralled by the way the brain works
is that the world came to be the shape that it is and animals work in the way that they work and that we work in the way that we work and and that is romantic it's extraordinarily i mean the most romantic thing i remember as a child age seven hitting a rock seeing it fall open
well i'd i hope not and believe that i certainly don't think um that the bbc will dumb it down uh i mean if the if public service broadcasting doesn't do that what's the point of having something
long as i can keep vertical and keep moving and people push me in front of things yes yeah because i i mean it's the best job in the
really got it you know cause i've cause i've i've i i go away but i i've been doing playing lots of bad guys over the last couple of
yeah so i mean it's nice that they can finally they can finally see the why daddy goes goes away um it's it's great because they they're really
they call the mountain top which is uh you can find out about it on dot the mountain
he makes a famous speech where he he says i've been to the mountaintop i've seen the promised land i might not get there with you but i'll i know we'll get to the promised land and the very next day is a
and that night he talked about death he's he talked death for an
there's a storm outside and it was an unseasonable storm and everybody that didn't nobody could understand why
and the play proposes that he meets a mysterious stranger in in in the night
who um forces him to confront his mortality and the future of his people and it's it's very moving and it's very um it's very it's a very interesting play because it deals with
and uh uh asked the question you know is this the promised land you know we were in a if if martin luther king were
um extraordinary changes i mean here we here we have as i say a a a black a black president and um
uh one one of one of the amazing things that i've discovered during my research was just how it
in america at that time how much racism uh that there was in in america at that time and to think that that same country can then vote for a black president fifty
back in my my school days i was given this speech to do it was a it was a section of the i have a dream speech and and i i didn't know what the i have a dream speech was i was only about twelve and um i remember
play for the i used to play for the arsenal ex professional celebrity
um bone marrow register at the anthony nolan trust go down to your local hospital because there are thousands of people out there who who need a who have leukemia or a a blood disease and the only thing they're waiting for is a is somebody who who with of a
a similar tissue type because if it's a black person you have to have a black person whose blood and if it's uh uh uh a chinese person they have to have a chinese um you have to type chinese tissue
than it was twenty years ago uh which is when the register started we i think we now need a more
and we're all needle phobic nobody likes to to to to have needles and i you know i i had to
and them um on the fourth day i was able to i was hooked up to this machine but i you know if somebody asked me to sit cross legged for four hours
um the rum and the sugar and the i mean the caribbean was one of the richest areas in in the world
i mean flowing into the uh um uh british coffers so the owner of the plantation uh lord harwood uh was made well he was made a lord and all at the end of slavery when all the slaves were were
fifty people turned up i mean it's astonishing because we are all related
and and it was amazing cause so many people come up to me and went oh yes you're um from so and so yes i know your father and it so it was
what was what was astonishing is that we we showed them harewood we showed these these these people in barbados harewood house and they were like
but you you you can't you can't kinda get get too above yourself in birmingham you we um we like people to be kind of real and and uh as they are
because i've been in los angeles for the last eight months and i i i mean i've watched it on my computer but i had no idea just how people were taking to it here which
extremely wealthy they make a lot of money selling some of these really horrible weapons to rather dubious regimes all around the world and they are given red carpet treatments around the world they are they sit at some of the top tables around the world
to just navigate their ways uh uh through society um really making a living off these truly awful
i've become a professional american which is extraordinary but um yeah i play a character
think they underestimated how difficult it was gonna be being an american in amongst so many british
voices that was probably one of the one of the toughest things that i've i've done as an actor
um which would be fantastic to be to be a part of um and uh hopefully things work out and i
i said be this real classic british spy drama which we you know we wish we did more of them and and uh le carre's probably second to none
there's no guarantee that you're gonna go on to have a successful career so i want to
in america um and it can be quite brutal you know you can walk into a room
it doesn't matter who you are you could be ian mcshane or you could be a a beginner you walk in the room and you're treated exactly the same you've got eight minutes or three minutes to go and do your
it was a letter from you know a brown envelope from her majesty's government i just thought i'll i'll open that
got the courage up and i uh uh i i kind of i thought to myself i'm just gonna open that right now so i just peeled it open and i was really really i was
i i i'm not always supposed to but i i i told my mom and obviously my partner and and uh and some close friends i mean it it's just i'm staggered really really staggered i mean you you never think that
uh i'd been filming a series called homeland which is um uh a show a showtime show in in america it's got um some fantastic fantastic actors claire danes damian lewis uh mandy patinkin and i think it's coming to channel four in the spring um and it's kind of based around the the whole idea
ought to been turned by the by al qaeda it's and it's really gotten under the skin of the americans it's it's been a real
golden globes so not a bad start to the year three golden globes and and uh and
idea i i know that somebody has obviously gone into bat for me and and whoever they are you know i really take my hat off to them because they've i i know that somebody's actually told me that that the process that they have to go through is is quite a rigorous one so they obviously have to write endless reports and and fill out endless lists and and really gonna say really go into bat for me so you know i thank whoever they are
i think i think you know these are tough times in television um all around and i and i think i you know gone are the days when we had you know long running shows like london's burning and the bill and
very different uh uh different days but that being said there's no doubt that over the last four or five years um there's been an exodus of some of the top black british talent you know to america and they've you know they've they've been finding that they're you know open they're playing roles of real authority real
and that's just on without question um it's moving and it's changing and i think the likes of idris elba are coming back and taking the lead in in series like luther has proved that
yeah it's it's changing and it's a lot better from when i was growing up i mean you know i i remember watching a black and white minstrel
things have really changed that we we really have come along way it's it would be nice if we could go go that extra extra mile and and see a much more diverse uh uh picture in advertising and and uh and in leading actors so you know we we have to live in hope and you know hopefully things will
well i i did i lost uh i lost my best friend louie who was you know i met when i was twelve years
had together it was the one event that completely smashed me broke me and then can you believe i
to me a kind of a spiritual message for him just to say go on lad get on with it you know it's time to move on and and you know this is this is the kind of
my family don't think i've got a i'm like my my kids are my kids are very happy that i got home that
in the sun and swimming every day and having a wonderful time so um you know it's i i i'm just
i really don't know i just got uh a letter saying from number
because as you know um unfortunately bless him john sullivan the creator of it all he very unfortunately died and as he was as as nick lyndhurst used to say
apparently it was uh it was part of some notes that john had left in his uh you know in his desk and it was re put together by his two sons jim and dan and they they
uh you know would he do something of course and he said yes and during the course of the conversation he said he'd always wanted to work with uh he loved the show and could uh be great if he could do something with me and
as soon as you start putting the things together like you know he becomes a a
uh del boy would use a bit of french and uh rodney said you learn your french
uh invention but basically they were it it was just it was just john's way of saying that this character was one that wanted to impress and the way that you
how it actually came about was that john sullivan and i were in the bar having a drink after one of the shows and he said to me i was in the wine bar the other he says you might like this dave he said i was in the wine bar the other a funny thing happened and he said i was standing there having a drink and there was a bloke over by the bar and a
point to where i understood what was really funny and what wasn't and by that i said i could do it and i'll do it and i'll fall right through
i used to be an electrician and uh my partner and i we got a contract down at
and when i got the script and uh i did the reading and they said would i go and play uh uh del boy i said yeah and i spoke to the writer and i said what how did he view uh derek trotter and he said oh he was a guy with a flat cap and a big beer belly and uh you know this and i said to him no no i know i
was there were two unauthorized biographies of me and the people who put putting the book together wanted me to do it they sort of said at the end of the day they said look if you don't do it someone else will and isn't it better for you
over the years they said you've had such an interesting career
and i i was saying well there's i've got nothing to say really but when i analyzed it and thought
and uh and that's the story of every and i think the thing about it is that i discovered was
where it perhaps may lead which is uh fame and fortune
was that i could never ever quite fit it in because there was a when you go back to fools and horses we get into a position where oh well we want to do another series so we gotta start work on it now and in the meantime i would go back into the theater or i would be doing
position where oh well we want to do another series so we gotta start work on it now and in the meantime i would go back into the theater or
it never happened or do i keep working and my choice was i
i had funny enough i had a meeting with claire caudwell a lady that was here in charge of comedy and uh we had a meeting with her and mark freeland who had a comedy in london and we're trying to find something to do and it came out of just an accidental conversation that was i wonder what ever happened to uh granville
the thing about him was not only his vast talent and he had a great talent one which i would
that he was also a gentleman but as opposed to a
he was he was so generous and kind and his feet were very firmly placed on the
um in those days that we all were desperate to move about anyway the long and the short of the story was a bicycle
my father being very entrepreneurial he got some wooden blocks and put the
so he had to take the blocks off when he wanted so it was who's got the blocks or are the blocks on or are the blocks
the one of the most important things was that where we filmed in the streets in doncaster they hadn't
first went round the corner to see for the very first day of filming it took me straight back and do you know that for a minute i was expecting ronnie to come out of that
cause ronnie used to have it and the second thing is of course things never get easier and budgets get tighter so
ronnie used to have it and the second thing is of course mm things never get easier and
into less and less time if that makes sense so the pressure is on not just for me but for everybody because we all want to give the same quality to the show but
vegas vegas sorry johnny vaughan he's not with us anymore johnny vegas
of of uh doing it in such a short time as i've said cause you gotta have a good team around you not only do you have a good script which we had but we have to have a good team and we've had one of the best teams uh going and i'm sure you'll see that when it
see who is this now this was a letter that was written to santa and it went like this when you're
well she's no fool you may be thinking that a kid never asks for mummy but it's for my
she's always saying that work never gives her enough so i just want her to have a bit more
uh tonight debuting is the second season of another
and king julian on netflix we're also in the middle of taping for bill burr's animated series season two of f is for family and that's a lot of fun what else continue to recur on the goldbergs shooting a pilot for cbs there's a movie coming out this fall called priceless which is gonna be really good it's not a comedy and also uh the headhunter is calling so i got nothing going
you know what the good new is you don't have to grill these recipes can we talk recipe just a little bit it's one of my passions i love to cook i hate the word foody but i do love to cook um
don't be intimidated by them they're juicy they can be tender all you've gotta do is not overcook them
put that in there go well first of all go to grill for it dot com i've got all these recipes on there i'm gonna make you a cook by the time we're done with this interview dan alright you marinate it for nine hours now i put these on the
high heat five minutes a side you can do it in your house or let me guess coleman indoor gas
oh hey this is like a ted talk for us dan you can go down to one forty five pull that off you've got some nice pork here's one i'm gonna throw at you you probably haven't had i'm gonna guess you ever had a pork burger
just a squirt it's a hot sauce danny mix those together pat up some burgers put those on the grill and you can panfry them too dan if you like how do you normally cook your
i'm gonna make you a cook dan i'm gonna get you at it one way or the other you can panfry these or you can cook them on your grillforit dot com last thing i'm gonna throw at ya dan and i don't wanna blow your mind my guess is you've never barbequed a
let's talk about this i like to make my own dough because i got five kids i gotta keep em busy
ingredients on the top of my crust i'm gonna put down some barbecue sauce i'm gonna put down some cooked pork loin or if you like a little pork shoulder maybe a little pulled pork bacon sausage whatever you like put on some broccoli just a dash of olive oil on there you can close it and oven it dan till you know it's done you've cooked pizza before in your oven
add that to my pulled pork recipe here or my pork burger recipe
sauce add that to the gochujang sauce for the pork
it does right what's the biggest lesson of the day don't overcook the pork one forty five to one sixty is what i call our pork playground dan will you say it with me one
they are at the recipes can be found just type in grill for it dot
and i tell you what it's the best way to have a good father's day i'm gonna be cooking all three of these recipes and posting them on instagram danny you on
a grilled pineapple you put a slice of pineapple on the grill for just a little bit till they get marks it makes the flavors come out the sugars come out really pops
well i tell you what you put pineapple on top that burger you're not gonna be single for much
uh it's a job and it's a lot of fun what what about that wouldn't you wanna
i've never been a zombie that's that's fantastic so you can you know you open up
took a picture of every movie you've been in or every television show you're like wow look at that different thing there and there and there plus makeups
it's all makeup or you know the physical stuff from from the onset choreographer mark
uh and uh rawlice was in charge of the makeup trailer god damn it they're artists
yeah it was astonishing to me too how great it is when you start to see them put on a vein and it pops it's
i i did do a little research and there is you know there's a real hard core dolly parton male uh
the channel uh that's there um obviously there's not a lot of improvisation with a
you've gotta be pretty specific and you know it's take to take what can you do you wanna do something different but it's kinda fun you're you're you're playing with a
they weren't supposed to so the younger one's like what are you doing that's just what's on tv like what are you
what do you mean you watch three walking deads you're eight no no dad it's so good dad sit down i'm like no
they're like what the how's this guy there uh so i'd i had to say yes of sub genres only now i've had i've had a real fun time playing at different ones i mean from final destination to even piranha three double d thanks to
genre picture it's more of a thriller that was awesome but i you have fun in all of them there's just more ways to have a good time
my wife and i had been dating for a while and she told me about a dream she had that i had proposed to her at her old
and she said she was running around the corner and then i came around dressed in a clown outfit that's what she told me this dream was and then she felt terrible that she said she had this dream cause we weren't engaged yet and so
she just stared there all day long just staring at her hand it was so sweet so
and now i think she probably regrets that decision every day since then like
you're as lucky as i am cause i've met your wife we're both outclassed we both leveled up so
uh i well adam mckay said no he was tired of getting the question cause when we were doing press for the second one that's the only that's the first question they'd ask so how about a third one what are you
it just kept building on that last one we could really tell there was such a fever for it um but i don't know if that might happen again i would do it every every year i loved doing those movies it's obviously an amazing crew of people
be like indulgent be like well we could've used it on our way to get christina out of the bear pit but originally it was getting christina out of she was captured she was
choices you've gotta make your choices and that's you know that's the way it goes i think you can still see that online but it
and it did go on forever i'll tell you a little trivia about that scene if we have time we were all not wearing pants
why there's a reason this guy's on ten ten programs um full circle is an amazing piece of theater i'm gonna call it i
it's kind of like if if anyone remembers the old playhouse ninety days where you would do a play basically so there are ten episodes and multiple characters and some of them intertwine
and then shoot twenty two pages in one day where you normally shoot four or five so when we shoot twenty two so it's like you're doing a
and it is fantastic it's uh an exercise you rarely get to do anymore as an actor you actually get to rehearse which most days you show up and start shooting so we get to rehearse uh and we get to do this play basically and they're filming it it's a really really cool project so i get to do one with uh patrick uh fugit and then the other one with clarissa
uh or you know it's a commercial city but it's it's always taken the art seriously that's what's great for me so i never felt out of place when i said i wanted to be an
in london but i grew you know and the thing about liverpool is when i said i wanted to be an actor it wasn't weird the only weird thing was i wasn't saying i wanted to be in a band which was the big thing everybody everybody had their drumsticks or the guitar in liverpool that was the big thing but i went i had to go to the big city to go to
yeah then you got a find that time you know but it was that thing that i came out to a noise of silence really when i
and stuff and all these young fresh faced students would come in and they'd look at me and i'd sort of embody their worst fears
shakespeare and i was saying yeah that's three pound fifty now come on and get home so so so i eventually had to get out of there and get into a place far away from any drama
so some of them have gone on but there was uh there was a sense of you know being in there and them thinking that they were gonna walk out and be in a tv series and then they're always doing a proper job in trying to make
uk and it was uh my calling card really it meant i was the lead in this and it meant that whenever i went to auditions and stuff i wasn't just making stuff up and saying yeah you might just see me i got cut from that you know and they were able to see what i was in and that was
you know i whenever i done shakespeare or been in the west end he's like oh yeah whatever but you know being in this walking dead i've suddenly become cool to him you know
it's like he's seeing me for the first time you know and his his friends like the show so it's sort of quite good you know and i can get him tshirts and stuff so it's all about what you can get him
uh uh he's uh like okay hey dad can you get me another one of those hats you know so
his his girlfriends aren't so into it you know the the his female friends but uh his his mates
i mean a it's got all of its big noises it's got the zombies and all that stuff but it's about what you would do when you you know when you're up against it uh we all like to think that we're gonna be heroic when those things happen and that we're gonna you know the best of us will come out but we don't really know what's gonna happen until it
the council's decision on whether to hold tight or whether to spend their way out
the majority of people feel that they should be spending their way out of it whereas i don't i think that we should be hunkering
know it until it came as a script andrew davis' wonderful script and i went back to the novel and i loved it i
before the book came out as well but the book actually feels like it was written in the fifties it feels like it was with retrospect
she talks about the persecution of the jews and and the fear of going into that war or possible war and you feel that this is a book that's been written with the benefit of hindsight but she
to see the socialist side of of britain coming to the fore and also you know him stuck in his conservative ways but uh i think it's a it's not this chinking crystal world of britain it's not a place that is sort of
the place the place that uh the hollies live which is this place called the shacks which is this
yes being eaten away and you know there's a lot of people who think well we just can't do anything about that they'll just keep
and other people debbie character really wants to reform all that and rebuild that and that's you know those clash of
redgrave as lady macbeth so i'm really looking forward to that we're in early days we start rehearsals next month so i'm busy sort of reading every text
what's interesting for me is it's at the liverpool everyman which is the theater i started in where i it was i was in the youth theater there and that was very much inclusive in the the main
it's uh you know it holds a great place in my heart and it's about to be knocked down it's about to be refurbished in the whole area of liverpool so it will be one of the last productions if not the last one to ever be performed there so it was a no brainer for me i just had to
dealing with the supernatural then that does give an extra an extra spin but i myself have decided not to
been talking about um right now i'm starting to get superstitious about it but yeah i think you've just got to
though his leaving of office was amazing i thought you know um
two sons came out of downing street so i really felt that i'd wished i'd seen a little bit more of
i could see him on television shows like this but what i could never find was the private man and what he was like off camera and that was harder to find and i think it would've been nicer to see some of that um but you know it was all about um timing for him i think his timing
the council's decision or whether to hold tight or whether to spend their way out of that
the the majority of people feel that they should be spending their way out of it whereas i don't i think we should be hunkering down
absolutely it's happening right there i mean she was very uh she was amazing author um
and know it until it came as a script andrew davis's wonderful script and i went back to the novel and i loved it i
before the book came out as well but the book actually feels like it was written in the fifties it feels like it was with retrospect to to the time of uh she talks about hitler and the rise of national
she listens she talks about the persecution of the jews and and the fear of going into that war or possible war and you feel that this is a book that's being written with the benefits of hindsight but she was writing it right there right then so
to come at them but she makes this wonderful speech at the end about go forth so bravely and sort of be you know take on the
and see the socialist side of of britain coming to the fore and also you know him stuck in his conservative ways but yeah i think it's a great it's not this chinking crystal world of britain it's not a place that is sort of rarefied
the place the place that uh the hollies live which is this place called the shacks which is this
has being eaten away and you know there's a lot of people who think well we just can't do anything about that they'll just keep
and other people asked uh debbie hensel's character really want to reform all that and rebuild that and that's you know those clash of
i crave is lady macbeth so i'm really looking forward to that we're in early days we start rehearsals next month so
what's interesting for me is it's at the liverpool everyman which is the theater i started in it i it was i was at the youth theater there and that was very much inclusive in the the main house of the theater there so we were always running about and in shows and stuff so it's
it's a you know it holds a great place in my heart and it's about to be knocked down it's about to be refurbished and that whole area of liverpool so it will be one of the last productions if not the last one to ever be performed there so it was a no brainer for me i just had to
macbeth is cloaked in this dealing with the supernatural then that does give it an extra an extra spin but i myself have decided not to
even talking about um right now i'm starting to get superstitious about it but yeah i think you've just got to
his leaving of office was amazing i thought you know um when his two sons came out of downing street i really felt that i'd wished i'd seen a little bit more of that in his in his uh premiership really i've
you know for his own decisions he's decided to to keep his private life very much
cause i could see him on television shows like this but what i could never find was the private man and what he was like off camera and that was harder to find and i think it would've been nicer to see some of that um but you know it was all about um timing for him i think his timing
what he was like off camera and that was harder to find and i think
i we we're going to this church near where i i live in north london and i was obsessed with my pastor's daughter uh she
would sit at the back of the church i didn't listen to a single sermon probably for about a year and then one day uh she she came up to me at the end uh of the service and
and it's it's a tragic ending by the way um i woke up to
drop the rose we get on the train we go to the to the um theater and uh she takes me backstage to this room where there are youth
kept going cause i i liked her that much and uh before you know it um you know i i i
uh we shot that for two two to three months yeah two to three months and um yeah
to play someone of that magnitude you you've gotta go there so to speak i had the privilege of working with um uh forest whitaker on on a film i did called last king of scotland and and with daniel day lewis my favorite actor of all time
yeah well we saw a lot of it in atlanta and if you're gonna play dr king in atlanta where he's
he doesn't engender much confidence uh so uh so so i decided to to stay and
we were moving house at the time and i remember she called me uh once and said okay so david what are what are we gonna do is it is it the the brown curtain
world war and um he was after that he was gonna go back and be king of his country but
yes exactly right exactly right and uh but he fell in love with this white girl and um
truly but because there was such a powerful nation in relation to great britain this was after the second world war and the cold war was just starting up south africa was supplying great britain with uranium to fight that war supplying great britain with gold and threatened to leave the commonwealth if they allowed this marriage that would take place just across the border in botswana to to to happen so great britain uh in my opinion behaved rather disgracefully and and decided to exile these two
to marry which they did anyway the the the the church wouldn't allow them to have a church wedding so they they ended up having a a civil wedding and um and then once they tried to go back to be in botswana uh the british government
because botswana was a protectant of of the u k and they said in order to help you guys not have in your country we are going to help you by not letting you
well i am actually a prince from nigeria i know it sounds like showing off but it's
but i'm i'm in a in an interracial marriage myself so yeah there there are several things
well i don't i've been in a dressing room with him for three months i i i don't know
yes uh i think that's fair to say um um but
play you know in this role is everything i am as a man you know um who he was in terms of sacrificial love what he had by way of his faith what he did in terms of not just
uh uh a talker of the word but a doer of the word these are all things i really admire and aspire to do but also an actor to get to step into his shoes briefly that's who i am professionally and who i am in life is what uh you know or who i try to be in life is what he was so you know it's
i think what i not only found out but what i felt physically in my body is the weight of expectation the weight
were killed uh during the course of this campaign and they were killed because uh the methodology employed was we're gonna go into this place where there's clear injustice we're gonna have the cameras roll and we're gonna make these people act out on camera and they did and people died and you could argue that they may not have died if it wasn't at the behest of this
you no longer had uh white racists not going to jail for having killed people because you know juries were letting them off so you know i'm sure he knew that but it was still
with incredible women he surrounded himself with as well that's one of the things
came along and rewrote it the fact that you see diane nash you see amelia boynton you see annie lee cooper um uh in in this film uh you see coretta you
towards civil rights she was the one who had who who had grown up in marion alabama and and and like i say inspired him in this way so you know i
and yet was able to just steal their ideas articulate them and
and that affect you um and thankfully you know i think a lot of a lot of the love a love
he this is a man who was cold you know he was twenty six when he headed up the montgomery bus boycott um twenty six i can't what was i doing at
he knew it and in his moments of doubt in his moments when he wanted to turn around his faith
and there was another victory every time more people rallied to the to the to the call of his voice he's his feeling of responsibility grew and his feeling of of uh courage grew and that's what enabled him to go up against you know world leaders and and advocate for people
easily easily and maybe the most important thing i ever do and i'm okay with that because i think it's really timely i think there's something divine about it i was with doctor king's youngest daughter uh just over the weekend and she said
are engaging in this now um and uh and and it's humanity coming together not just not just black people but now i think the eric garner situation really just made people go okay this is indisputable this is just wrong and you know what i hope somewhere shows is that voting is crucial um we we cannot expect change when we have been given that power when that power has been bought
issue of the day in selma was voting rights today it's police reform who's going to police the police you know it took federal intervention with the voting i think it's gonna take the same thing
uh uh with the police brutality situation and um
summer and he walked straight up to me i was in costume as doctor king and he said doctor king it is
frozen uh by that because it was what a what a what a thing for him to say having not seen his friend for
little strange at points i have to say you know because there was this
saw mine he walked straight up to me i was in costume as dr king and he said dr king it is
frozen uh by that because it was what a what a what a thing for him to say having not seen his friend for
um bumps in the road towards this this moment uh i actually got attached to the the project officially in two thousand and ten and still we struggled to get this film off the ground but when i look at what's going on in the nation now and it'd just being such a perfect time for this
selma and he walks straight up to me i was in costume as dr king and he said dr king it is so
frozen uh by that because it was what a what a what a thing for him to say having not seen his friend for
little strange at points i have to say you know because there was this
is eh we only get the scripts kind of as we film them so we don't know where the story's going so oh from a from a a a somebody playing a police officer though that's quite
um it's in ukraine so it starts the uh you saw just in in that little uh uh sequence there it starts on the steps of broadchurch police station in the middle of the night uh julie hesmondhalgh has uh turned up at the police station and asked for help she's been
christian our writer immersed himself in getting this exactly right in in exactly what the procedures are when someone's suffered a terrible assault like this and uh i think it the
one of broadchurch's kind of unique uh selling point if you will has been that it's it's not just about the crime and solving
people who've been victims and to the eh and to the community around them and three years after a a boy dies and sort of
hurting from that and then this other awful event happens and and i think it's it's as much about the reality of what that
the ticker's ticking away yeah the pacemaker's working but i mean you know this it's gonna come
perfect no this is it well chris chibnall our our writer our show runner he's off to go and run
um uh i'm yeah i'm playing don juan and and and don juan in soho it's a very modern take on the
just approaching well there were two weeks of rehearsals left so just getting to the kind of
mad to be normal but rd laing the the sixties counterculture
and and and through into peter davidson as well i'm still watching when when he was well when he
and uh uh uh you kind of you kind of can't really think about it when you have little objective moments
be seen but i certainly intend to do another one at the moment that's the that's that's what i'm planning on doing uh at the
oh i'm fine that's fine i'm i'm happy to accept whatever adjectives you fling out
heard a lot about that yes there's a there's a similar moment actually um yes harry potter four i'm in that
uh banish those thoughts from peter's head on christmas day but i think you know as an actor you want to do a variety of different things you want to do as big a variety as possible uh and it's it's great for me to have been able
to to be now going into doctor who which is a a a family show and is is is very kind of
it has a very different feel to it um uh from an acting point of view that's what you know that's what we want to do as as big of a writing thing
and for straightforward and that russell writes it and sends me this great and so i go well that's good thanks russ and you just kind of do it cause i mean he's such an extraordinary
you just when you get a script from him you just kind of devour it and get stuck into it and he gives you so many uh brilliant lines and different ways you can take it that you just kind of roll with it and and i think that's how we've been doing it really we we're kind of responding to what each other's is giving each other and and and and and if the so there's no we
we didn't want to kinda sit down and go let's make it self consciously quirky let's make this doctor different by giving him pink hair or a parrot on his shoulder or because then you just get into gimmickry really and i think you've gotta it's gotta be for all that it's fantastic and extraordinary
about two months early but you'll have seen there it's uh it's a bit knackered it's been taken off the uh the container uh boat and they dropped the container uh carton on top of it
well when i read the script it was quite an emotional moment and i there are a few emotional moments obviously in in uh in the telling of that story but uh
it's uh it's been a fantastic time and i'm i'm having a ball doing it and it's a
the end is nigh but um you know i've still got a good way to go and it'll be till the end of the year before i'm
can i it's not you know uh it's just part of the job i have it usually it's not it's usually not a sexual thing with a
i think it's only gentlemanly for me to say they were both equally good and very
um you see i don't like to pick favorites like that i think they're all uh
they're all uh uh they're all exciting and scary and thrilling and it the scariest is whatever you
we're filming at the moment they are they are some of the best scripts we've ever had it's very exciting some amazing guest stars some of whom you know we've been we've been pictured we've been filming the streets of cardiff this week and the some of our guest stars have have already been leaked there are some even bigger ones that people don't know about yet it's
it will again but uh he's very excited he's he uh i think he's a great choice and he's very he's very up for it and ready to
i think he is yeah yeah and there's a lot of great people around him so uh i think he'll be
those props are worth quite a lot of money and uh and of course the series carries on so i i i can't exactly take it
it was off the screen for for a long time i mean there there was a the uh uh an an attempt to revive it in ninety six but that didn't really work
i'm hosting jonathan ross's show he's off for easter so i catherine tate and i are gonna try and be djs for three hours uh from ten o'clock which
i think it's wonderful i think any opportunity to bring the fans and the cast and the producers and the writers together it's always i mean that's that's why
you know share and experience an artistic experience from performer artist
you know the audience and i think that it's wonderful because we're all one really we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them watching the show and i think it's really great that they have this uh this outlet to bring us together and talk about you know what's interesting about the show and what's wonderful and what's compelling and people's opinions i think it's i think it's great i think they should do it
interested in in what's gonna happen with every character and how whatever happens to another character relates to my character and that's the wonderful thing about uh being on a series if you're on a
characters no matter what happens to one character it's gonna affect all the other ones so uh that's that's always a great thing for me that if i hear that you know uh cs lee's character masuka something's happening with them it's going to affect uh my character
like a new field of play as an actor to explore and to sink your teeth
and uh that's why i i i you know when they say oh how can you do a series for so long you kidding me i would
because there's so many aspects of that personality that you can
and it's always rewarding as an actor to dive in there and find certain things that you may not even have known about that
particular individual that particular character and so that's that's always a good
i you know i i really look at it i i guess i'm a positive person cause i don't have too many negatives
i i it's always sad when it ends and you have to wait uh you know months to come back because you've invested so much in yourself in the character so that's maybe the frustrating thing i wish it was a little bit
i uh yeah i'm i'm very busy i'm gonna be doing a a movie coming out with sylvester stallone called the expendables i'm um filming a movie right now called skyline about uh science fiction
and exactly because of what you just said it's exciting that nuvotv is gonna show it to a whole new demographic of of people of latinos of and um every monday at nine pm two episodes the whole
um every monday at nine pm two episodes the whole series from beginning to end
you know the the great thing is i think that every character was interesting and every character was interesting in relation to the story of dexter and uh and the writers did a great job doing that particularly in in maintaining the integrity of our characters when it came to our ethnicity our culture um and i'm i was really excited every time i read a script and uh we really it was it was a great eight years to play the
well for me you know the show is about a a man who uh because of a traumatic event when he was baby uh has acquired a sickness that uh that he needs to satisfy uh which is killing people uh uh a serial
and um being involved in the world as his dad was a was a police officer and he he taught him how not to get caught and how to now satisfy his urges in in a code that will then help society in getting rid of uh other really bad people uh whether they're killers or child molesters or uh he found a uh
a a code to actually satisfy his urges and uh also
uh image of normal life in in his world
and uh and and it's it was is an interesting concept and what's interesting about it is you get to hear uh everything he's thinking everything he's planning why he does what he does and he shares it with the audience so the audience knows more about this character than any of his closest friends or his sister or anybody else and uh and that leads to
you know the the great thing is i think that every character was interesting and every character was interesting in relation to the story of dexter and uh
bautista's wardrobe i always found i always i always what i liked about it is that he was definitely you could always you know point him out in a crowd
he had a unique wardrobe which is what i liked about the character as well um and i think he maintained that whether he was in a
a little more conservatism i guess no but i think that he always had that you know with the hats and just the the same kind of you know
unique shirts that he wore that was a little different from a normal homicide detective i would say
we want people to discover it as they go along i think this is a good opportunity for them to uh to watch the uh you know all the uh all the surprises and that are gonna come uh within those uh ninety six
david zayas on dexter don't go anywhere cause profile
except except the viewers yeah so yeah and what he does is um his code in
in killing people uh he kills other serial killers or other bad people people that you know are would say you know would
sergeant angel batista who works alongside of dexter and uh is his friend and um doesn't know what he
well yeah i i wouldn't put it i mean the sopranos was huge the sopranos was iconic um but it is it is uh one of those great cable shows that have been coming up you know in the last ten years and i think uh dexter you know is is probably one of the top five there i think
yeah he's uh you know and he's got a tough job cause he's there every day almost
to where where he wants to take that character and he just knows exactly you know it's a very structured and very interesting performance that he gives and uh he's
i think it has to do with the quality of the show um uh you know we don't nobody really knows how successful the show is gonna be till it starts airing but i think the quality of the quality of the show and and uh
sure and just the reputation that it has within you know within the world of of show business i think that it attracts a lot of good actors keith carradine for one was was just wonderful i learned a lot from keith carradine he's um a professional at every level and of course this year jimmy smits who i've worked with before on broadway um is just a a
and then they switched me to manhattan and i worked in uh central park i worked in manhattan north task force which we worked mostly in the three four washington
ways uh wanted to be an actor i mean i was always been a dream of mine um but you know i come from a very blue collar background so that kinda was like a dream outside of the reality of what was uh going on in my life uh i got married young i had two uh two children
and uh i joined right after high school i i did like a year in college and wasn't for me and i joined the air force and i did five years in the air force and um
the city test and i went right in to the police department and i did fifteen years and then about halfway into that um had a bad year i got divorced i went bankrupt and i said well this isn't
i started going to a acting class and and studying a lot i really got into it i did a lot of theater a lot of uh
i study with this uh wonderful teacher called ernie martin who's probably uh one of the best teachers in new york that people don't know i mean he's he's just
i taught a lot of great actors and um and then i got into this theater
i have with that is you know you get for example if i was playing a doctor and they're giving me all this jargon medical jargon it would take me forever to like try and figure that out uh being a police officer in the past it's a lot of technical aspects of of whether when you read a script uh when you read a play
be a lot of that you know even just the the way a police officer you know stands the way he walks the way he you know he observes the uh the location all of that pretty much comes naturally to me you know and so uh uh it gives me the to really work hard on the character work of uh of
and you know what i don't mind i i'll i'll i'll play as many cops as they want me to play you know i think to me if the role is interesting it doesn't matter what it is you know if i if i see something if i'm reading a script i'm reading a play i'm reading a
a a tv show uh a film if the the character's interesting to me what that character is whether it's a cop whether it's a a killer whether it's a a priest it doesn't matter if it's interesting if it catches me uh something that i
to be a vigilante to be a superhero i don't believe that was the the the backdrop of that i think that maybe it's developed that way because people uh you know wanna see it that way i think he's just uh he's a human
and aside from that little aspect he lives a normal life and he's probably a real a decent human being it's just that one i mean uh uh there's people out there that are decent human beings that have these addictions or have these urges that they need to
lot of people or not that it's condoned but it's understandable in his mind that i can do this i could take care what i need to take care of to satisfy my urges and
of someone who had a plan when it comes to my career quite a lot of it has been an accident and i wouldn't recommend that
during the day at a big comprehensive school in london and then i would go and perform at night and and five pounds a week for performing
he loved it and the moment came when i had to make a decision because everybody else who was performing at the comic strip were free to go on tour to
but i was not free because i had a proper grown up daytime job so i had to make a big decision about whether i was gonna jump off
initially uh but i knew that i had to follow my heart with it in fact it it is a calling without a doubt you you cannot get rid of those
creative you have to follow your heart and so i made a decision right there that i would leave teaching for now and then move into performing and that's when i knew that that's what i'd do because i would take
be returning into education in a way that i've always wanted to and with time um
you know with as my decrepitude creeps on and dad goes and as i become more delusional um i i you know i want to teach more and where
i keep on going is because every new project is a change and i have tried to change from uh comedy acting to serious acting to writing to uh a one woman show that i did last year which i rehearsed here at falmouth with one of the falmouth
about that and that's why i fell into my career thank goodness almost by accident later on i think i would have got going earlier and how great to have these resources and by the resources i mean not just the buildings and the amazing facilities
earlier on i i can't imagine what it would be have been like and to know that the that this
left cormel to go and seek an arts education if i had known there was an arts
true yes because uh i'm halfway through my second novel at the moment and i am longing to get
so uh it's i i feel like i just wanna get back down to i
push through i read that graham greene said just write anything anything to
even when you type something up but i find that when it's on the typed page
god that's homework i think um i used to ask len after certainly when i did my memoir i asked him you know
she is not me she is a woman kind of my age and i've tried to write in this book
she's at a kind of dangerous age where if somebody pays a bit too much attention to her outside the marriage she could get a bit giddy and that's
but i've tried to deal with something that i think i fear the most which is that you can take your eye off the ball a bit sometimes with your family and with your kids and whilst you do that and
and i have seen it happen with i guess in certain moments with my daughter i have been busy working or something like
over fifty you just kinda have to pay attention to your health a bit i want to be there for my kid of
i need to be well you know and i just i just ballooned up a bit more than i wanted to but you you know you can always address it you just have to eat less and walk more that
long time but the last thing i want to be at the moment is in a great big relationship so i'm doing the opposite to anything i've done
by really relishing it but i'm quite a strong person and i'm well loved so i feel kind of very
i'm there i've got them all there with me and in fact my parents with me who have both passed on now sadly you know on stage if it i it's one
way i've written it really but i've only got two more nights of it in london and then
well some of the references i think i'll have to have a little look at some of the people that i might take the mick at a little bit i might have to find the australian
i wanted to write about a girl from cornwall going to manhattan that's the bit that's
i've written about in this book i mean this young woman does make a decision she's running away from something a little bit um and she makes a decision on the plane that she's going to say yes to more things than she ever
cause there there are some saucy scenes in this book obviously uh they're very
is i have to take myself there in my head and at that moment i think right well this is the sort of thing that might happen there this is a
i just kind of write notes and then i narrow it all down and when i'm right in the zone of it
my editor was the first person to read it and i did say i haven't written it like this before i haven't you know written this kind of stuff before and although that's not everything that the book is because the the book is about the
for me as i was writing it i can see it i can see it all and i know who should play rosie and i'm you know i absolutely feel that it should be a movie but you know you have to wait for the right for that to
may i add that she had handed me a script and i was very surprised by it because she's a massive procrastinator
we finished at at that point but i haven't called in on that money because she's done the movie
work right next door at warner brothers so for me this was just a hop skip and a jump not like last time in new york that was a little
i don't like i don't like being in planes i don't like being thirty forty thousand feet in the air i don't like that that makes me a little uncomfortable i think as it should i don't think it's a very natural place for a human being to be but on the show i obviously have to fly quite a bit and uh
i gotta go now and they they let me off but the the the pilot had to interrogate me for about five minutes they pulled my
the lot a lot of kids grow up in malibu in this one area it's very strange i mean so many kids from
and and tom were very good friends so i grew up in a in a neighborhood that had all these kids running around and they're just people you knew and and ran into now i run into now i really i i think he's pretty awesome myself i i i'd love to have a career like his
it's such a strange thing i i don't think your undergraduate education does anything for you as far as like the real world
kind of i i took a couple classes and my father's a film director and my mother's an actress and i
five friends who grew up who've grown up together they get caught inside a bank in a bank robbery and they've all have been away from each other for three years they get back
turns into a hostage drama it's really it's a it's a good ride it's really a drew barrymore
so much fun and god that girl has a lot of energy made me feel like i was gonna she's young she's so she's like twenty one to twenty two years old and i felt i'm like god i'm thirty i'm getting up there
picture you know it's not a it's just not all about me like with other good real good actors sean patrick flannery the kid who played powder he and a and lot of other good actors there's it's just a nice grouping of people and i
data it's uh produced by wwe studios so it stars a wwe superstar uh big show paul white
he did he did the fights and i did the fight i did every fight uh he fights better than i do
hot that day and uh after take two of his doing it uh i was in there for the
tuck me back in but it was so much fun it was so physical but the the fighters were great it's like a dance and uh paul was phenomenal big show as he's
guy but the nicest guy in the world i assume until you get him angry well i'm sure when you get him angry uh that's not a good thing but
the hulk hulk smash but he's a nice guy he really is but if uh we we had a couple times i mean i hit him square in the head
oh and he just goes come on i was like i don't know what does that mean we still shoot or you want to fight because i don't wanna i was like uhuh yeah so uh he no let's keep shooting i was like oh
say anything he looked at me and he goes that was close brother i was like that's not funny
oh not at all think about it there's so many worse things i could be called and have been called uh so to be referred to as superman all the time it's a it's a it's wonderful i love being part of it it's the greatest american icon in the world here's the most
small town kansas with small town american values and he's the most moral good person on the planet
a lot of reality stars um which i'm not used to but i cook so here's the thing i cook probably ninety five percent of the meals that are eaten in my house uh for myself and my son and then every once in a while i order pizza he doesn't like to go to restaurants he likes my cooking he likes very simple basic food and i cook all the time so i've always wanted to take a cooking class and i've never had the opportunity to do that this was uh a way to do that it's called worst cooks in america but i'm not the worst
i uh that's well done uh great guy really great guy jaleel and i have been friends for fifteen years but chris was a just a great dude barry williams of course i grew up watching the brady bunch which apparently has never been off the air something he told me that i never knew never off the air since it
he was a former professional football player american football which it actually i was as or i am and uh
he's fallen in with the wrong crowd so to speak and uh the his wife is the woman he
he's not uh he's not a nice guy and denzel's character and and my character really don't like each other at all and we've always competed over everything and he's actually having an affair with my
actually i had just i was just growing a goatee uh just to see what i looked like and then i
i i wasn't too keen on those that was a that wasn't the most comfortable outfit on earth but playing a bad guy is great because you get to
you have no morality in that sense you can just kinda let it fly and that was fun but playing opposite denzel is you know for me as an actor was most it was
i mean that you could ask for nothing more and uh you know i hope the film does well here it's it's uh it's a hot steamy movie which will be nice
uh we ran into each other uh just at a cafe and that was the only time i've seen her since the show ended so uh i i saw her her ex husband recently she's getting a divorce i guess
yeah that long ago that i finished playing the role and for me i you know i've played i've done twenty
that is i'm not trying to shake it i i i'm very proud of the work in that in that show and i really enjoy the show uh but uh as an actor you wanna do different things and i played a bad guy in this film i've done another film now where i've played uh uh uh uh a kind of a geeky nice
horrible guys i murdered now in another film so i i like just to pick different roles if i
single episodes were what the people brought to me the fans i mean they always spoke about it in the generalness of they all the shows helped them they
know what i'm saying but they didn't come about only one time i remember this time because of the way it happened i'm on a
i've worked all week my call this morning was six o'clock and i'm on a ten fifteen plane i have worked all day coming
is take a little nap for this hour and fifteen minutes so when i see my husband i be
cause i'm tired and i'm mad and i'm all those things so i wanna take
on the last seat in first class before you step in to coach and the they
i got my pillow and my blanket around me and i'm stretched out in my seat and i'm going to sleep and this lady who is getting on sees me and she stops and she says i have to
my husband was twenty six years old wasn't nothing wrong with him he just
see and i have two children i didn't know what to tell my children cause i didn't know what to tell
and going home made me know that my husband was comfortable
your daddy's fine he went a trip he wanted to go on and we'll see him again someday
he he remembered the first situation comedy he was ever
he wasn't writing the show he was the star of the show but he had so much
been an entertainer so long that he had an answer for almost everything he danced
jack would do an act with him playing the
they're now they're off that just that much and they'd be off and they would entertain us on the rewrite days and the days when it took too long to get the script and you know so it was it was all fun and games it was
i was i had a roach coach uh uh meal on
the land that jack's garage was standing on and so that's how i was
the coach so i was on the premise a lot and jack did things that were not in his lease and that's how we had this back and forth going you know he he put cans out where they shouldn't be he knew they shouldn't be there but he his character was whatever i
do that and so we had this between us all the time and
came uh uh like i was his mother he began to on the set act like that you know like we
i i was his guardian or his mother or something and whoever was writing said let's put
and so that became that became my relationship with him when jack got on his nerves he would come across the alley and uh talk to me and uh we'd figure out something
present himself as some of my best friends are black i know a lot about black people and i've been with black people all my life which is very offensive in its connotation very offensive
and you like him why do you have to pull that out you don't come in and you say um i i knew some spanish i knew some irish people i knew some english you don't do that people are people and so that friction ran between
uh the one of the producers and i can tell you how to be funny if i want to and redd was saying
came to interview red and so we're rehearsing a scene and all red had to do
and i said he's having an interview with entertainment tonight i said but he doesn't have any
and brings red out and when red gets out there and finds out all he has to do is walk across the back of this that anybody
and he was laying on the floor and i leaned down to him and i put my hands on him he said get my wife get my
get my wife get my i said somebody get paramedics and somebody go get mrs fox and they went and got her
the doctor comes out and says uh mrs fox we've done all that we
television that way again because if if something happened to me and they treated my husband and my daughter that way i'd
and sat her in there and he never got the treatment he needed he was not uh phased out of it like he
and i didn't get sick or something and so he was no longer in it just one day he was there and one
the name la gravite struck me because in uh i guess it was
nineteen ninety uh a a guy named richard lagravenese who was nominated for an oscar for the fisher king and when i i think it was nineteen ninety
up in boston named who was there for like two years and then dropped out and disappeared right so can't be the same guy it can't be the same and so teddy met with the writer to see what his take
on this film with um and was involved the whole way through and he's got a great sense of humor and i knew him everybody loosened up it was great and uh even when kevin and judy came on
they uh everybody uh got along great and everybody cracked everybody else up and it was
you know there's not a lot of it so you go on stage at stand up comedy clubs because you can just get up there you don't have to worry you know about how much you get paid and you just go up for ten minutes and you can talk so you get to work with some skills instead of you know at your waitress waiter waitering job or your your uh job at a diner whatever it is so that's what brought me to it originally cause i was out of work as an actor and then you you get up there and you sort of enjoy that uh uh performance uh skill which is different from from you know acting with a fourth
like uh being in the moment you know you really have to be completely in the moment when you're doing stand up comedy especially if you're if you're not a joke teller if you're sort of just somebody who makes observations or tells stories you have to be right there because the audience is there is no fourth wall and anything can happen people can can react to you and and vocal you or whatever so you're always like right here you're very
you know there there is no greater uh immediate thrill than having it when it's working and it's going well
and to play um other angles and emotions inside of yourself that's what you get to do in film and it
uh and uh and there's there everybody's had the experience of having to be someplace at a family gathering on christmas eve or thanksgiving whatever it might be where you you sometimes things just don't you don't wanna be with everybody you wanna be with one of the people maybe cause you like them or maybe there's that one you're trying to avoid and you wanna be with the other ones but there's always some nightmare
yeah and the laughs come from from uh from the characters and not so uh so so much the
i mean even the kids you know are upset about the presents they're getting which is just true to a lot of kids when you're getting that that weird age when
family uh they all have a great sense of uh storytelling they tell great stories they have big senses of humor um so i think it's
you know you know so it's almost being in grad school where they go here's a camera go out and you know bring back
if i'm if i'm gonna uh if i'm gonna enjoy it and if it's if it's a challenge and so far everything the next thing has always been sort of a challenge you know uh moving from doing a one man show into
that uh that's a dramatic piece that we're at some point in the future hopefully gonna do but we wrote it with the idea it's a it's about uh
in the closet thing forget about that even if they waive that rule you know just some of the things that that they always go back into your past and try to get stuff that can come back to
like my skinny jean squad there's gonna be a squad there's gonna be people in government vans that are gonna drive around and pick up people that shouldn't be
talk about you know the whole lack of civil rights during the bush administration i'm sorry i'm pulling you right off the street and we're giving you clothes that you're gonna be okay and this is not just fat people this is like skinny people wearing crazy outfits we're just gonna take you off the street so that's just the beginning of my
and you can walk down the street and report i'm serious you turn on the thing and you get
and you're just a uh a human atm and a chauffeur
ever done i'll tell you it is uh for a a british television i'm amazed at this footage
having this nightmare that i was walking out on stage uh out on that show and i was dressed as a woman but i was me but i was dressed as a woman and the audience of course was in shock but i had to
and sinead o'connor would like they would do two shows at once so like sinead o'connor and i think david bowie were both there and it was oh creepy
uh and i don't know why that footage has never shown up that's the girliest thing i ever did walking down those that
to play and um you know i'd like to play as a red sox player in a red sox game now billy crystal went to yankee stadium i went to uh spring training for the yankees you did you see that
tape than half the guys who are playing right now who are half my age so i think uh and billy crystal
who's also really fast just put me put me in center field put them in left and right they'll cover me you know i guarantee i'll look cooler than billy crystal did and uh i'll stay out of the way
well my kids are twenty three and twenty five and so that in their generation you are forget david letterman you are like you conan and jon stewart that's all i hear about in my house every day oh
stewart conan kimmel kimmel and i'm like hey first of all i know these guys and they're scum
they're geniuses okay it changes the way you go to the bathroom i go this is classic alright two rich white guys with their heads so far up their own
okay memorial day weekend i'm i drive everywhere i didn't drive out here but i drive everywhere so i'm driving from detroit uh to new york i only drive trucks pickup trucks and big ass suvs that's it okay which drives my daughter nuts dad the environment
fast endangered species i'm like hey listen i'm a fifty seven year old white irish guy who smokes and likes coffee flavored coffee i'm an endangered
so i'm not spending the next thirty five years driving around in a prius eating steamed kale it's not
so which is what i buy at the burger king while i'm driving from from detroit to new york i stop at a burger king i get a i get a bacon double cheeseburger that comes with biodegradable napkins which is hilarious cause the cheeseburger is gonna be in my colon for the next thirty
yeah and i'm driving and i drive fast and i've and i smoke and i listen to music loud and i sing it's like pickup karaoke right so and i see a rest area coming up and you know that thing we all do where you check with your ass right we all do it when we're driving
thing where you're like i could clench it up for a while i think i could do the twenty six miles right which is really easy to do if you know when you walk around clenching your ass cause you have to take one
stop singing cause you don't want to hit a high note if you got one in there i'm not even humming at this point and i look and i see like an area i'm like i could do this area i think little clearing going into the woods right so i pull the truck over i get out of the truck and i'm kind of walking backwards cause i'm like i want to just get back far enough that so people can't see me by the way one of the
i looked up i didn't look far enough behind me twenty yards away is a fence and people are having a barbecue
blown away cause when when the fan reaction when i do a movie i expect fifty percent of the fans to hate it and fifty percent of the fans to love it and majority of the fans
alopecia um that means i basically don't grow a lot of hair and when i watched part four as a child when corey feldman came down the stairs uh dressed as young jason when he did the makeup and the had his
uh getting an audition for for a part i i really i think this right and i actually turned down other movie roles just to audition actual like job offers i'm like no no i i have a feeling i have this just feeling i i
and my background in stunts helped out a lot um i didn't have to do any special fight training cause that's kind of my
in the the stunt world you know i'm doing martial arts and uh i do anime as a uh
someone's who big and slow not that that's a bad thing it just what we've seen before the character their interpretation this time is he's more of a
comes out on uh june sixteenth i believe it is uh there's a killer cut version of the film there's a theatrical version and there's also a killer cut uh what the killer cut is it has a uh
uh extended footage of the movie so a lot of the scenes are expanded so you'll see like uh um like pictures behind the scenes you'll see the one jason looks like underneath the mask so we shot scenes where it revealed what it looks like um what else is there there's uh there's scenes like where you see like travis van winkle the uh the trent character um in extended kill
that was i actually come up behind him with a machete with the blade turned up i slide it between his legs uh making a rather phallic look and i grab him uh or i grab the uh uh other end of the machete and i pick him up in the air and
so the uh the brief sex scenes that happen in the theatrical cut aren't so brief in the killer cut they're uh i i i got to the point where i'm uncomfortable i'm watching them like okay what the
which i haven't seen yet uh but what i hear is there's a a a a what's called a trivia track but normally that means there's like pop ups like like this happened here and just words about trivia for the film but what it actually is is a little picture in picture and it runs throughout the entire length of the uh the movie where you'll see of course trivia but it's basically like a mini documentary you'll see a
a little strange having a a the the dvd camera guy brad brad follow me around twenty four hour
acting like a four year old you know with a machete like sword fighting with the tree or something like making voices uh of course i'd stop and look over and brad would be right there
sequel right now it's uh it's still in the rumor status um where it's not officially green lit the writers uh mark swift and damian shannon are returning they're actually writing the sequel uh as we speak um uh being that it isn't
i do have a second picture option with platinum dunes so they have first grab at me if if they want me for it um i do have a really good relationship with them so i don't know officially if i'll be returning i would like to so um cross my fingers and
before the what's gonna happen what's not gonna happen i really don't know i uh i've heard at one point it was greenlit then it's not greenlit then it's happening again then it's not
i don't know i really don't know i think it's all up to the studios i talked to to platinum dunes and they they said they would drop what they're doing right now to if the uh studios wanted to do it so uh we're just waiting to see i'm um my own personal
about predators um what can i say about predators uh one thing i will say that knb efx knock the predator designs out of the ballpark oh i'm so
i don't believe it until i see it but actually seeing some of the uh the new predator designs
um my character's called uh brutus jackson and i am a a big badass how weird
just to what happened or or what we we've seen in part one uh i believe they wrote it so they could fit anywhere but it's almost as if it were a
um but it gets back to it's it's hard r it's back to what we want or it's brutally violent and uh it's a a roller coaster ride when i read the script there was like hardly any breathing room it's always something happens somewhere move move move by the time i was done reading it for the first time i was exhausted so i'm i'm excited to see how it turns out i haven't seen anything besides the
got up and do whatever he wants to have some stand in do the lines it was super freezing he was the one with the wearing the least amount of clothes
you are an amazing human being so a lot of respect to adrian he's a great great
knew uh what he knew today that i was gonna be in a uh amazing predator suit i would lose my
uh uh i told our director on set he would jump up and down and scream in joy and go
edward is uh a giant troll in hansel and gretel who is enslaved by the evil witch muriel um he has a struggle because uh um he's
heart of gold and he wants to do the right thing by helping gretel out but uh he has to overcome his own fear of uh being punished from uh
trolls are born to serve witches and he was born the kind that serves the white witches uh which are the good witches and being that they're
he has no no purpose no no one to serve um he tells a story about coming across and meeting muriel and she could have killed him but she doesn't and so he is sworn
he lives in fear of you know being hurt by her and so when he finds gretel
he has a connection to her he realizes that she is a white witch which gretel at the time doesn't know and
he had lived his life without purpose and that's his purpose and he's conflicted because he has to overcome
and uh it's cold it's rainy everyone is you know uh huddled together for warmth
on set is a hoot uh it's so wild because being that he's a newer director uh and this is his first big hollywood film
i'd seen directors in the same position be under so much stress uh trying to get their idea across and there's so many different things going on and they become overhwelmed with what's
with the edward character it's pretty crazy uh it's uh for myself as an actor it's like i'm
i see out the character's mouth when it's open ua h but in the scenes it's very rarely open uh so you as an actor you almost have to take a mental picture or photograph of what you
where that is for your movement because during the scene i'm completely blind and a lot of times you think you can use your sense of touch to feel what's going on but my hands in the character stop about just below the wrist of edward and they're giant animatronic hands and we have a um like uh uh a guy from on each of the hands controlling them
everyone's trying to row the boat in the same direction we all wanna accomplish the same goals and um just had such a good time with
a lot of that comes from tommy tommy set the pace for the the the feel of the show that that he's so kind and generous
what i really enjoy about the film is that it's it's unique in a way that it's not just a a strict fantasy genre film fantasy's a part of it you have uh the comedy you have
uh uh like stand by me or a goonies as a child that that action adventure of of a of a
into this film and so it's such a huge demographic you'll find something that you like in the
i you know i try to deny it sometimes like oh you know i you created this character not everything is autobiography but i relate to mavis
yeah you know um uh we're both writers we're we both tend to write about teenagers which is kind of a a strange fixation um we both wake up in the morning and drink diet
some unhealthy habits there um however i i don't think i'm
first of all just the sheer amount of effort that goes into making a film but then even when you get past that to just watch a director especially a director like jason who's so incredible interpret what you've written and then you have someone
and they're up there reading stuff that i wrote you know alone it's a
i was i i was completely in awe i'm in awe every time i watch the movie i'm i i'm not
mysterious to me because i am not myself an actor and i don't i just don't know how she can transform her
uh everybody knows he's this incredible comic i mean he's he's brilliant but it's i don't think people are aware of what a great actor he is and they will be when
you know i think about it i i i went through a phase where i think i was uh
but it is it i was sometimes shocked by how much people put out there like do you really want like creepy old maid from your high school looking at your kid's
that's the weird that's a very it's a very strange time and it also is one of those things where
obviously really amazing and humbling but it's also like
yeah and that's uh that that was uh that's the working title i think we're gonna do something differently but it's yeah it's i'm gonna direct in a couple months and
and octavia oh my god who by the way is you know having a really amazing run
initially have meryl in mind i you know and i would never uh i would never be that
because she gets so many scripts and you know uh you can't assume that she's gonna do yours but um as i the the longer i worked on the script the more i started to think it has to be her because she just i i just i knew she could knock this role out of the park so i was very very excited when i
wasn't i i thought that i i thought that i i was gonna have to talk her into it and that's why we were having dinner and so i was prepared and i had this whole spiel and it was like i'm gonna i'm gonna convince meryl streep to do this movie and it turned out when she had arrived she'd already made her mind up and so when she started talking about you know production i just i wanted to jump up and down and scream but i
what happened and it it was such a great decision that our director jonathan demme made he said he didn't want anything in the movie to be artificial or canned or done in post production he wanted all the music to be recorded live and everybody had to be playing their instrument and singing so that's definitely a more challenging way to shoot a musical film but like
movie so i was acting in a couple of uh capacities and you know typically i
you know i i'm very respectful of that collaboration but it's it's great when they need you as a writer
it's you definitely have to really really trust the people you're working with because you write the script and then it's pretty much out of your hands you're you're at the mercy of the director's
um it's strange though it's not what i expected i kinda thought after i had kids that i would start writing scripts about raising little kids and being a young mom and no i'm not young but you
i it that strangely enough that wasn't my instinct and now instead i'm writing about someone whose children are an adult
one moment that i cannot forget you know what i had a cameo in the movie and i got to dance in the bar and in in front of the flash the band you know while they were performing and meryl was singing her heart out and i was just doing my goofy dance moves and
vegas you need to go see ricki and the flash you have my guarantee that you will love this movie it's highly entertaining heartwarming
mavis gary is a author of young adult fiction and she lives in
did to her entire life and she finds herself at a place where suddenly there's something that she wants and can't have and it's her ex boyfriend who is married and she decides that she is going to drive to her hometown break up his marriage and get him
it started um as just a desire to see a female anti hero on on screen
i can't even remember what movie it was that set me off but i had gone to see yet another movie with a really dark complicated interesting male protagonist who was you know kind of a curmudgeon and really flawed and maybe an addict and i and it was you know a performance for the guy and i thought
that was my primary objective when i began but of course it can't just be about making a statement you have to find a story that
and a character that speaks to you and so that is how mavis began to
i was so thrilled when jason reitman called me and said
because i honestly i i never dreamed of working with somebody like her she is just the
she's just at the top of her game she's got an oscar she's an
bravery i i think it can be difficult to be associated with a character like this you really have to have guts to say that i'm going to be mavis
after in the judo process to be there for a lot of it and jason is a really great collaborator um this time
i was you know caught up in my personal lives but i was at home watching dailies and every night i would get this round of dailies and i would think to myself like wow look what they're
the great thing about working with jason is i don't feel that i have to explain myself like there's just no
and their love scene i guess you could call it but it's really awkward i know spoiler
i i i remember seeing scenes from it and thinking like oh my gosh this is incredibly uncomfortable what is this going to be like
mavis and matt are a really unusual pairing because she is the type of guy that he would that that she he is the type of guy that she would ordinarily never look at and in fact she went through four years of high school without ever looking at him even though he was like basically her locker mate um and yet i love that he goes from being a person that she would
she cares about most and the one person she needs the most because they in a lot of ways have the same
a lot sweeter than she is and he has uh you know an essential warmth and goodness but when it comes down to it he's a cynic too
my hope is that people feel that they have seen something that um
because uh i i think that the ending to this movie is ambiguous and it's challenging and even in even along the way
oh it took about six weeks of rehearsal dance rehearsal that probably a week or so you know every day we'd do some more of the we rehearsed on the disney backlot in ninety five degree heat we
i i had so much fun rosie that i've often wondered whether i was making an honest
in this but i was not and when they started putting that leather suit on him i said are we doing motorcycles or
uh i kept asking people whatever happened to stan laurel and nobody knew one day i was looking in the phonebook and uh there it was it said stan laurel not stanley so i called him up and introduced myself and he knew who i
and he knew who i was from the show and invited me over and i i used to go out and spend sunday afternoons with him and just
it's such a joy to work with my son it's just lovely whoever thought i'd be playing a
you know i had to beg walt i said i want to do the old man and i won't charge you a nickel and i had to do a screen test for him and everything he was an old horse trader walt i loved him but he
dick and bob sherman wrote the songs for both of those movies and there's nobody like him around anymore all those songs are so
the dick van dyke show and uh in those days i knew i was nominated it was just a little dinner party it was never
they had sent me a wire and about a week afterwards i just had to look
and it said congratulations you won the tony you know and was all by
directing a film that his partner norman lear wrote called divorce american style based on norman's life i understand and bud was a pleasure to work with it it it was debbie reynolds and bud yorkin and me when it was
i never never did i think i left a bad taste in norman's mouth i'll tell you one experience i had in the
nineteen fifty six or seven when she came to new york and
did her i love you john foster dulles and we both started appearing on the garry moore show together so we've known each other all those years actually it's cause
the other english people but i think i was one of the few americans in it i think there was one or two other people who actually weren't british you remember arthur treacher who played the constable
well as i said i was a fan of his from the time i was old enough to go to the movies my mother'd have to come on saturday and drag me out of laurel and hardy movies and when i was a
i'd ask people whatever happened to stan walt and nobody knew i was looking for a phone number in the santa monica phone book and
i i spent that afternoon with him and several after
dickie if anybody ever plays me i want you to and then when he passed away i was invited to do the uh eulogy at his
he was the guy who practically put me in the business we were online trainees in the in what was then the army airforce and i told you byron uh
what was then the army air force and i told you by
brought me at his own expense before the cbs execs and they put me under contract which got me
doing my act so my mother and father and jerry drove all the way out here in their old chevy
went home to high school got a partner bought all the records we were pantomiming and started
yeah just to watch him it took so many years for them to find the right part and he was
that's the the perfect part for him i'm hoping that the abc
to make my own decisions then i never encouraged never discouraged him and uh when asked why he he went into business he he used to hang around the the van dyke show
yeah he'd he wanted to do some drama but he did he probably has more pilots in the can than anyone except tim
absolutely yeah he's very persuasive and he's a strong when he goes in to talk to the network and because of his past successes
they listen to what he says because his opinion is valuable and i've i don't think we'd be gotten on the air without him and he's been instrumental in keeping us on the air he's a figure i hope you guys have
no you you've covered just about everybody that i can think of especially all the people that i admire
walt disney called me about the part oh he was an old shoe it very very nice everybody called him uncle walt and uh i could see
and i was he took me around and showed me the storyboards the sherman brothers played me the score and i just
it was my dream to do a walt disney movie of that kind you know a family movie for kids i was always
well i had to donate four thousand dollars to his his art school
finish up six weeks of very tough rehearsal on the on the backlot they built all those uh rooftops out of plywood in ninety five degree
sang for weeks getting the numbers cause that was my main worry oh well when i
it was maintaining my amateur standing in almost everything i do has meant been a lot more
british lady most certainly but she's an imp underneath she's a she's a practical joker she's a she likes to have her fun but uh easy to work with now i
then but you as we do you know our show now one camera is bits and pieces from various parts nothing even follows so you can't really do a performance as such you're piecing together one it's more the editor's job than anyone and i never found doing movies that much fun cause if you ever heard the list of
the difference in mary poppins was doing musical numbers that's something else because you at least get to do a whole piece of a
um well i i think it was just that i got very attracted to the film because i heard that nick hornby was writing a a
mm that he had wasn't developing from a book that he had already written i love his books um and i read this and immediately you're confronted with a a a very multi layered um intriguing well developed script about with characters who you completely relate to and understand immediately which is very uh very rare but when you get such a talented writer as him
as write such humorous rounded characters you're immediately compelled to to be to be part of it which i desperately
i loved her ideas for the piece and how uh sensitive to she was towards the era um how much she knew about england at that time and about the change that was about to dramatically sweep across the
heartfelt story that i that i thought everyone would be able to relate to in a way i completely understood where the characters were coming from and the situations that they were in and the desperation to change um the route in which they were bound to be taking i i just think it has many human issues that we can all relate to
for me things in films that make uh makes make a film appealing if i can relate to it and believe it and understand it and feel moved by it then i'll care
comes from a very privileged and wealthy upbringing i you know the moment i saw the apartment and this character and how
and then he's gone every sort of top of the range musical instrument he no doubt can't play um all the latest art
we were going on in the time he was a very well educated
you get these costumes that you can that you can put on that change the way you stand and the way you feel it's inhabiting the world in which my father you know where where my mum
was like which ultimately sounded pretty depressing if you weren't if living the lifestyle in which he
and so then you question why why is this person who has all this stuff
and everything that you think you could possibly want why is he still going around to old women's
and we just got on immediately we were kind of and he's so and one of the reasons which i think the film works
i don't know how what by no it doesn't help on any level what you mean if i'm out of an evening and i say i'm robert downey junior's father that
well what i loved and i think it was totally inspired by the fact that joe our director came from that world
of um invention and set design um it was very specific and
how we perceived the future in that era it couldn't be too futuristic but it was it was
and it wasn't all green screen i think people often are under the misconception that we're just standing in a green box pretending that we're working with various bits of machinery or just sitting in a chair making it look as though we're flying a plane
the truth is actually this was all pretty much built so to actually feel it and be a part of it and and see it helped tremendously
you every day in awe of it the magnitude of it and how much thought had gone into it
and it said a lot about the man himself i suppose this incredible entrepreneur
great ideas which at the time would've just been mind blowing um and i love all that i love to think how far aviation has come in such a short space of time
taking off of the first plane to a plane that travels the speed of of a of a bullet you know that we have actually done and that's not fantastical um yeah so it gives it gives some idea this playboy fun loving ladies man is actually also an incredible mathematician
ingenious so having that being a part amongst that was really a
and that's what you do as a kid they're the worlds that you that you live in they're the they're the inventions that you make with your friends let's pretend we're doing this and suddenly you're you're doing it for real um you don't really know what to make of it i don't know what to make of it
you kind of in a way it's certainly the devil's double we stayed away from that because we didn't want it to be a an accurate historical biographical detailed account of those events therefore you have dramatic license as with this this is it's a comic book so you can talk about it in that way if if you want to but yeah and they're all
yeah hung up and worried about those issues um you know why
stark industries itself is creating you know what is it creating was it there to create weapons no it was create creating these to protect and to save and to help
than it was from shooting the devil's double which was very small and i'm playing two parts in it and feeling a little very much at the center of
the creativity of it and and and and the ability to believe that you had a say and that you could change how it was being shot or how you thought this character
should should be because you're completely inhabiting it when when you're doing such a vast um scale movie uh as the the marvel comics you'd be um where you could be not be there for three weeks at the beginning of shooting and then you'd be there to come on and suddenly start throwing your weight around and deciding how you think things should really be
is in a way harder to suddenly come on board something and and believe strongly in what you've already created and your ideas behind this the character of howard stark and and and suddenly you're you're you're showing it to people and you're on a set in a in a massive arena and and it it can be very nerve
have to just i suppose believe but if if you don't like it you don't like it but this is what this is what i've got and
because his father um very much helped him get back on the throne and they sneaked uh charles out of england but uh when cromwell was trying to find him and behead him and they
troll again and he he reopened all the theaters charles second and made made england fun again and and rochester was kind of the at the helm of that in his
uh excess and and the fact that he had such a close relationship with the monarchy and with with king charles the second he always completely pushed everything to the to the limit um he was a very uh extraordinarily
germaine greer certainly thinks so and and it would put but i suppose in the way that he thought he was writing poetry and pieces of work and
and how they were thinking which at the time i think was very suppressed so for that reason yes but on the other hand also appalling in his in his um i
um there's dances and routines and it it becomes very sexual in parts of it but then it becomes very dark the latter end of his life is uh
piece of that i suppose and we see uh we see this one uh he the king commissions him to write something gives him a chance to show show his true talents and he comes up with this his one play that he wrote was extraordinarily um
if i'd met him i think it'd be very tough i think i've been i i
uh it i always knew from the moment i read it that it should be something very special and i think it it it's something that i would love to watch and i love
because i've heard so little about it and i didn't really know about the comics and uh i needed someone to explain to me how they were gonna turn adapt this and turn it into a series because i had no idea i was like i can understand the concept behind it but how are you
but they're such lovely guys seth was there with his producing partner and with the show and the guy writing it and there were about four or five of them big
trying to explain to me what this show was and i was sort of just sitting there like on what on earth is going on now but i can what on earth are they talking about explaining a a show where there's
uh uh it's really a pleasure mainly because uh people of your era and when you were on with the new
in heights i i was uh the school was right right opposite where we lived and it uh i only child
but oddly enough he passed away on the street in new york and my cousin at that time was an intern at bellevue and he was in the ambulance and he came not knowing it was my
i was very close to my father i don't know if it made me any different
my mother had more of an influence on it than my my dad my dad was a was a wonderful guy but
to make me come out and do what i do and i i really
little joint a little in those days they called it a strip tease place and my cousin came and i was backstage ready to go on and he said nothing at it he passed on and he came on and he
uh had things been different who knows but at that at that point i
uh not being successful in schoolwork unfortunately
if i can't it they let you know but i i was always able to handle it in those days hecklers and so forth not
not with uh up your kazoo and all that stuff they they do today and and they and i don't
not nightclub people just people that came in for a drink and said oh there's a guy up there
they thought oh that's the guy that's gonna make funny you know and i finally met my beautiful wife barbara
should know nothing personal but this kid can't come near my joint i don't wanna see him i don't wanna bother me and leave me alone and i loved him and have a drink on me
don't worry i'm gonna take care of it you know put a dress on him you thought it was a girl anyway
went to the and we sat in the lounge had a drink he said i want you to know you're one of the finest
who are now gonna be part of the copacabana family say
about it i made it a little shorter but that's pretty much what happened and every time i went on he'd make me come in the kitchen you're one of the funniest
i mean you know they're they're real real they they loved show business and they were always
to speak and you have to be in a in a show on broadway you know in eight shows a week
to me and he played the guy i i i thought i was gonna be the loud guy he played the loud guy and i was the timid guy
nobody could say what i said you know in other words we'd be at a dinner party and frank would be he said you know what i said frank i'm
and we worked together at the radio city musical and we had a bet i'd walk out on the
be a man walk away walk away don't embarrass yourself and he would laugh and some nights he was in a lousy mood and i'd walk away why
i i love them so i said many people were frightened of them because
and i the word is uh stuck with me i really don't and see nobody would come into a theater and if i said
terrible about you and it wasn't funny and it wasn't uh uh sensible
it's not mean spirited and it's obvious unless you live under a rock it's a
i was always that way and even in school even with my friends uh i find life
not because i'm heartless certainly not but when my mother passed away my mother
to try to in those days you you always got jealous of the next guy
respect and try to cherish what you have not be envious
i'm very happy my family my two grandchildren yeah when you
to lose a son at forty dan god forbid it was a horror
that's my wife to anybody it's strange how your head works because it
sometimes i use a a a mark that i used that i thought was very funny it comes to me on
you're an actor and like you're a newsman you can't please everybody you're selling
and you could say the dog died you know but some of these guys go go far
i'll say you are a pain in the you know what you know but i'll say it differently and then they
there's no need to change it's like the car's still running and the motor's still going and by the time i decide to change i'll be in the hospital
but no one has ever come up to me and a a fan and said i don't
for that guy and sometimes i didn't do what they said i did you know
it's not easy tom when you got a jewish family they're always there with begging for the money
yeah and it and it's great cause all the kids that might not know don rickles that well
the spots with the maretti and i'm very excited about it and it should be it should be great and probably uh uh i will skyrocket and this show will be a mystery because i won't be here anymore
excited about it and it should be it should be great and probably i i i will skyrocket and the show will be a mystery
of the of the high school found out that i was failing every subject and grabbed his chest and told me to take a cab
soon as they said would you like to join up i was overseas already and i kept saying to the japanese i have nothing against you i do comedy
my folks my father was a wisecracker and he was a good guy and he'd laugh my my mother didn't have my kind of sense of humor you know she was sort of a jew
it was a nice family but no i'm kidding my father was a classy guy but uh we we uh you know i i i inherited that i just i was always that way i used to make fun of my grandmother make fun of people punk people who were sick i made
i made fun of death i made fun of everything i make fun of this show because it is a funny
the kind of guy and you know with i was the one that always went to the the the synagogue dances the church dances and not too many church dances but i went to the synagogue dances a lot i didn't go to the church dances cause they were all playing bingo you know but whenever i went i i was always the guy that that got everybody laughing but never
we got a shot at it you know what i mean so i was always the the funny guy that never got the girl but i used to go to the dance and they'd send me they'd we'd all go in and to get attention and this took and i was basically a shy guy i'd get up on a table
we were very you you you woke up with a nun you know every morning i tom sit dance we didn't have that robert just sat there and said
i went to the american academy of dramatic arts i've mentioned this i think before to you and i went there with jason robards a fine actor and anne bancroft
yeah well hey i graduated they they i they even wrote me a letter because we went through a whole thing that i'd they said they'd never publicized that i went to the american academy you know because when you
academy and i graduated and i walked around broadway and i read for stalag seventeen and i read for uh mr roberts and i read for a lot of shows and i never got a job so i used to go to the loew state and sit in the balcony and watch a movie and my father'd say where were
ah all day long up and down broadway and i was in the back of them and then i was an usher in a movie i did all kinds of odd jobs like a million other guys and i never could get to uh to broadway you know so suddenly i i was always kidding around so i went into a dance i guy gave me five dollars and a guy gave me ten dollars then twenty dollars and today i'm up to fifty bucks
i must premise this by saying yeah i'm not making fun of the homeless uh god love them it's a tough
and joe bologna and renee taylor who's also uh on our show and she's wonderful she's a great actress and and joe
particularly that night was black gentlemen and they kept coming up here hey man hey baby i love you man you're the best hey hockey puck you know that old uh title i had hockey puck
punch me hit me get mad at me or try to hurt me and if they do i phone who handles all my
never no in my career i've had people that a bit annoyed but nobody'd physically try to hurt me and if they did what are they gonna do i'm a jew i sue
it was it was an inside joke i broke his box accidentally and uh and and i replaced it and i gave a beautiful uh cigarette box and we're friends dear friends and he's uh he's special
yeah did you ever work with him no clint eastwood's the kind of guy when i did kelly's heroes remember that a
which it is sir but all i could tell you is if you laugh at life with all heartache there's there's humor in most anything in the world and if you laugh at life and your heart is good and you're good and you go to sleep at night without planning to hurt anybody and you want peace as we all do i can only say i wish you that and think peace and think of laughter cause laughter can help a
why make it difficult if it's easy i more power to these people my answer to young people coming up i always say uh what do you think of of comics you know and i always say hey if you last thirty years and more as i have you're doing it right no matter what they do or say who
why why make it tough for them if the easier the better and if we find somebody that's great
funny you should say that because i always say to my dear wife barbara of twenty eight years and you know barbara and i love her dearly and i always said when the day comes that i retire i'll know that the audience is saying hey this guy's had it i'll feel that i don't believe uh some of the greatest uh george burns milton berle uh uh bob hope people i respect tremendously and uh uh there's a list of some and they say retire to what the
when the day comes that i think i've had it i i have i'm thank god in good position i'd like to travel
is to really respect the people around you i've been very
daughters of all time and nobody can replace him and i'm not a shining example i don't have to but i must say
it was all i wanted to be that was it that was my dream i dreamed about getting the
and i heard the laughs and that hooked me that was it i heard that response
um well i was the understudy to the lead ingenue and i had a small role
um kind of an abby like character in that she is not altogether honest
but you know this is based on a real woman this is a true story that she conned all these people out of their money she conned this guy into marrying
that i have i i'm engaged to this other guy but i've met this new guy who's who is really hot and i'm gonna go off with him and i've taken all the other
i said let's go off together and i call him to the hotel room one night and i've got all the money
york right out to california's to be in a major motion picture with one of the biggest stars in the world so i was like whoo
um but he was great it that was the first uh movie that he directed also and uh he was a wonderful director even then he's gotten better and better
and he's a wonderful guy to work with i i sound uh like really uh boring here but
he's not uh uh i mean he everything is very loose and and he doesn't rehearse a lot and he just kind of films it and and it kinda happens his preparation's very good though but when you're there
really i know it's a great film it's just that to see myself back then to see that shag haircut and those hot pants and
she's different uh it's just every day is something new something i probably she's more she has more of her own personality than i thought she would i mean it just blossoms every day she's willful and she's strong and she's sweet and uh she's
everywhere i go they ask me that people seem to be really interested they are talking about it they've called me and i guess many of the other cast members and asked if we would do it i said sure i think it'd be great fun i think they're looking for a writer now and i think it'll be either a four hour mini series or a four one hour shows
as i would have liked him to be mostly in foreign policy but as far as this country goes and what he's done and the kind of programs that he's tried to um to yeah uh the economy's better than it has been in a very long time the deficit is being
i just think he's he's terrific and he really feels for people out there he has a heart that feels for the
where i can figure whether or not he could run a country i don't know i don't think we know his position on many many things yet uh when we find out his position you know everybody's gonna go every which way it's gonna start to be well i don't agree with that and i don't agree with that i don't know if somebody who is not a politician can go into washington and work with the congress and run
the country i think the country is set up to be run by politicians and i don't think somebody else
i've had two really long relationships in my life which i feel were like marriages um i just never felt
i also have a a security that i find in something other than
oh no i mean i think there is for certain women their destiny is to to reproduce to have children to to bring up children that's a a valid and and magnificent thing to do i don't think it is right for everyone or at certain times
after the role the the producers knew me and they said oh yes yes of course we'll
well that's not good enough they'll say nah she's too soft she doesn't have the edge and i insisted that they let me come in and read which i did and
a lot of times and so she she was much more real than the average vixen
you don't spend that much of your time doing it even when you're filming i mean you might be there for twelve hours but you're not in front of the camera all that time so that i needed other things to challenge me to to keep me excited and i found producing is in developing material and
was really exciting for me and i found some very good projects and i'm real
it makes people laugh i i love the title and uh i'm gonna start that in may
i've got another one called runaway father that i've been working on for about two years we've been trying to get that script right and i'm real excited about that true story of a woman by the name of pat bennett who is
had a mini series called pride of royals i've got uh one called west end another one called riverside
real estate yes stock no uh i'm very conservative
accountant but i sign all my own checks i oversee everything i i knew some people got real burned by letting other people sign their
isn't too overdone you know you wanna i think there's certain times you wanna look made up particularly in the evening and stuff but but in the daytime that's the time to really watch out that you're not wearing too much makeup 'cause it
to some extent getting older but it happens to be a fact and the alternative isn't so good so
um but uh it's not so much a fear of losing the beauty because there's a lots a lot of other
though even though she does a lot of sort of naughty things she uh
she has her own reasons she has her own sort of morality she's not evil though she'd never do well she wouldn't kill anyone
birth and they wanted abby to have done it and i uh i said no abby wouldn't do that she's a mother and a and uh she couldn't do that to another
like the way she goes about things sometimes because she never sort of cries on anyone else's shoulder if something happens and
long time and i really got to a point after a while where i said i don't i don't wanna play that anymore because i it's hurting my psyche to
there's there's the good guys and the bad guys for the most part although on our show i think we have more three dimensional characters than
uh he's wonderful we have a lot of wonderful actors on our show a new actor who's coming on this
no but you know when you play a character for this length of time um a lot of you has to go into the character and the character can can rub off on you too and in some
no but i feel like i've gained a lot of confidence from her because she has a lot of confidence i feel
uh her ambition sort of has rubbed off on me to some extent and i don't think that's a bad thing uh i've tried not i
i have a morality that's there no matter who i play or what i do uh that's there and that's my core
no i mean i i do have good women friends um a lot of women friends as a matter of fact i didn't use to i didn't use to seek the company of women very
to like the company of women very much and now i do i find lots of very fun bright
yes it is as a matter of fact it keeps selling uh it's been out for uh close to a year now and uh it just keeps selling people seem to like it and and when they find it
well she does meet up again with the first love
pretty much all the sets to scale that was so impressive and also working with a a director as intense and as talented as dan
as yes i think it's incredible it's very rare for a studio to put up so much money um for a story like this and it's and also to trust
not a it's not a popcorn flick although it's extremely entertaining but you come you come out of the theater like
the you know i had seen bits of that but i didn't didn't really visit it specially for the project and i had read the book of course i was sort of made to read it in school and i i
it's hard to think about bringing something new that always that would just scare you i think all you have to do is look at the material and bring something
fresh in the sense that you just react to it i mean when you're put in a a room with actors you're just going to react to them and you're gonna bring something completely new anyway cause you're not going to have the same
you know and no one's going to deliver their lines the same way it's completely different production design completely different team so i don't think i have to worry about anything being new i just have to live in the moment and let things kinetically be created as as it happens
i mean it's a such a help i mean you just walk into these worlds and they're created for you so it's such a blessing and i think it's it's one of the first jobs i've walked onto the sets every day and just been like
my god i mean you think how much money must they spent on this but i think it's just the pure work the bbc just puts they they we they seem to have such a love for what they do and they work with such great
i mean i mean yeah those those costumes in those days were a little bit uncomfortable and it was
worked with the same costume designer worked with where i go the job i'd done before and she won a bafta for that and she's just so brilliant um that i was i mean i was just thrilled to be able to work with her she's just
yeah yeah i spent loads of time loads of time cause kids can only film for like four hours at a time or a day or something so i'd sometimes have to come in on the days and and film for the rest of the day so we spent a lot of time together and he's a really really cool kid really cool kid he plays the the youngest
i don't know he sees something he sees something and i think she's not not a nice person she's just
she's damaged just isn't she i mean it's not her it's miss havisham i always think that if you if you have a kid
um they can turn out horrible not that estelle turns out horrible at all but you can have someone that turns out horrible but if you put them in a different parental home they would turn out
be different i suppose um but he sees something he falls in love with her sometimes you can't explain it and he i think it's one of the most amazing things and the amazing thing about this love story is he just never gives up on her not once he
is still completely you know relevant today and um his characters are so brilliant that people just want want want
to read about it or watch it on screen and um yeah i think that's why people people love him they're just so their novels are so rich and full of life
costumes the the stories the the scale of it is just very it's kind of it's very
just two young people no different if they were two young people today two young people in this situation going through these things going through you know the initial you know the realization of what love feels like and the sort of how blinded you
and uh so for for me it was just about going back to to basics and thinking about two young people being put into
just you're totally lost and blinded by this this this sort of thing you know chemicals are literally just they've never experienced before starting to flow around your body and you have to you have to try and remember what that's like to sort of be to get totally lost
you are from your physical appearance to your everything and every fiber of your being this also i mean you know i've been a young guy that's been in love before maybe not to these
these feelings emotions we have so we have to go and tap into that and create the
i mean all his themes are still so relevant today i mean this story i mean you can go anywhere in the world and find young people that are in love but can't be together because of you know social conflicts or gang conflicts or you know arranged marriages around the world now this i think uh and then also on more of a a on a on a smaller scale you know just teens being in love for the first time and
like take you know take any box per se but uh i think especially as british actors
i'm drawn to it because it's something that we've grown up with and it's
oh yes this has totally opened my eyes even further i mean i enjoyed shakespeare before but not until i truly invested in this and fell in love with this did i actually
fall in love with this story and also his work in in general i mean i went to see othello the other day at the national theatre and i've seen it before but since doing this movie i i it brought a whole new level of
and um you know we got to do the horse training the dance training and i did the source the sword
been blessed so far in my career to to work with the people i have you know uh sort of damien paul in this movie and then
and like actors that i mean i grew up watching gladiator and that was one of the things that inspired me to act is working you know is is watching russell
to miss in gladiator and to work with him playing my father in the movie that i did after this one was so special there there are plenty of pinch yourself moments where you have to go i'm doing what i have dreamt of doing all my life i'm doing what i love with the people i you you know respect and admire so if i could be half the actors that half the actor that any of those are by the time i'm their
keep on making things as well but it's a yeah it's a it's a big time for me but i just you know trying to take it in my
physical you know and he's obvious done a great job with the the whole look of the film and his investment of his own
guys really have jurisdiction uh over the whole world to try and
in tandem with local police forces from whatever country the fugitive happens to reside in and so they have carte blanche really to to go anywhere in the world in order to track down whoever it is they're
and you know he's been tracking this this particular guy for many years and you
to make sense of his own life to um and somehow in some way feel that he's achieve
role of a as an interpol agent as a police officer as the man in in the eyes of the world who
you know clean up the the nastier elements of our society he has to you know achieve his goal which is to track him down so it's not easy for
you know what the ever the rights and wrongs of that are uh from his point of view i are they criminal elements that's he's killing anyways
to someone from interpol the fact is he's a murderer and he creates mayhem wherever he goes and he has to be
i mean the movie's great so hopefully the people who are uh fans of the movie the the video game
well i mean uh it's not a world that i am familiar with uh in my own life but i
there are there is that element in eastern europe and russia and in other eastern european countries you know after the fall of the iron
so i mean in terms of you know in this space that normal people or whatever normal person is occupying in
there's certainly an awareness of an eastern european uh mafia element um being present in in britain along with many other people as well but certainly in the last ten
you know a a an important relationship with my own father and having two sons now um one who's eighteen and one who's twenty three months twenty two months and the music of the clash was such an important part of musical history in this country and in the world
anger and such hope and such optimism and and questioning questioning all the time about what our society was about and what it was doing for the young people at that time and uh and great britain in nineteen seventy eight seventy nine you know just seventy eight was the year before thatcher came to power and we're about to have all those years of of
and uh she was the most polarizing prime minister that i can think of and and
that that that was around when i've been you know alive
and thatcher was not a popular prime minister where i was brought up and i was brought up in a very industrial area in fife in scotland
i think that the clash and joe strummer you know we're a sort of a a
nick who's dina's father and uh we we you know he's a single dad and he lives in the suburbs of london and he and he's estranged from his his his exwife who went off to live in a sort of hippie commune and
he was a a you know in a rock band himself but he gave up his dreams of being a rockstar in order to get you know a job that could pay the rent to bring up his two kids so he
opens a music shop he tunes pianos and he sells pianos and musical instruments and he also you know drives a taxi so he gets into a really bad accident and he can't work so his son decides to pretend to be you know to to be a woman and drive a taxi uh and he meets joe strummer
really sort of reclaiming his identity about what it is to be a a young man in london and and all that comes with and when he hears the
love johnny for i've known johnny for a long long time and uh i think he's unique as an actor i think he's
he's just such a you love watching him on the screen and he's got a great i'd say very unique uh energy to him and and he's a he's a very
poor of of the film industry and you know cause i've done a lot of movies in my time and the london film festival is a great film festival and i'm glad that i'm part of it uh in some way you know i've had quite a few movies over the years in the london film festival and it's and it's a wonderful festival and i think long may it continue
not not a bad thing it's just the way it is it's slightly been overshadowed by the the rise of the new television industry which you know was kind of started by netflix and uh
series of um snatch at the moment the tv version of the movie so i'm doing that my filming i've managed to stay in london i'm playing an east end gangster who's totally
different characters and similar characters but a different story and some of those stories and it's kind of inspired by but different
you know which hadn't happened then in an extraordinary opportunity from the character of
back in time and meets her her other her younger self and tries to steer her in a different direction from the direction that she herself took which led to obviously not a very happy ending so it's it's about her relationship with um ludwig gerald who i play who
to spend your life with but that's what she did so you know and men like that are are are are often incredibly attractive to women and no matter how many times you know things go wrong in the relationship women always keep coming back because he has this kind of charm and this hold over them so he's you know he's he's one of those people who sees an opportunity and exploits it
and um his own history obviously has contributed to the way that he's turned out in life and and the choices that he makes you know and i feel for that i understand that you know because he's a survivor you know the way in order to survive in this life one has to some people have to you know resort to those kind of tactics in order to get by
to yourself first you know because i'm playing him uh and so my history over or any character that i play you know what i've done in my life and choices that i've made uh experiences i've had
uh emotional circumstances i've gone through so one looks to that first of all and then you know one reads other people's stories you know i read chet baker and that was an extraordinary story you know his life was tragic and
you know listen to his music charlie parker and a whole host of musicians they have the same
from everywhere ultimately you bring it back to yourself and that's applicable
i don't know what the message of the film i mean i think it's a great story uh first and foremost
and i think everyone'll take something different from it you know hopefully women can get inspired from it cause
we can go back in time and change things it's really
encouraging people to to try and make the right choices and not to make the choices that are gonna
will do but you know you make your bed you have to lie in it sometimes
i you know i i'm i'm happy with the choices that i made you know and uh you know i have to to to live with that and you know and
know can can be quite destructive in itself so uh you know we
be with happy with what you got and you know what was it my dad said to me he said definition of happy uh of success is how happy
come to and get get help and and make abusive women uh
you know come in uh into the public eye so that it's uh it's not pushed under
i think it's really important that women have an organization where they can turn to when things do get
to which women can come to and get and get help and and make abusive women
action that they wish to take you know it's a terrible thing you know and the women live with it every day and a lot of silent uh women
that find themselves in impossible situations uh and hope
i um i did a couple of few movies last year that are gonna come out
toronto for six months i'm shooting uh uh a cable american cable show called um hemlock grove set
with my name yes and and stevie's my name when i'm in ireland and when i went to
the will and in equity at the time and so i had to change it so i picked shaw who was the great
for love of my parents happily but i did go daily to uh a convent until i was about eight or nine and then
and i've done it very many times actually and i could do it for you now but it would take up more than five minutes it would take thirty eight
yeah uh in that instance actually we were asked to do it for a festival and in in uh brussels so we took a house
in different rooms of the house so i began to associate the poem with the domestic realities rather than
a fantastic time a eh i mean it's great fun to have maybe two actors who normally do big classical roles to do big classical funny roles because you're freed from the kind of constraints of very very good language or the harnessing of incredibly uh dexterous difficult thinking or elaborate thinking and suddenly you're just trying to make nonsense funny and uh by doing that
and in my case i mean i i think i act as if the wheels are going to come off at any moment and
uh it's very hard t you know you can't be sure of this chemistry and i think it gets very sentimental if you start saying there's great chemistry between us so simon and i
but with a good friend and not much upstages that so i'm not there to bore anybody i really think if you're not going to have dinner i've got to give you an exciting evening so i think the
weep a lot i don't think i am but i think i am excitable and my mother is i've
she famously said she's bored but i played boredom through somebody who was terribly anxious and kept moving the furniture around so her boredom came out as
this is about a monstrous act isn't it by a very unmonstrous person and i suspect most monstrous acts are done by very unmonstrous people and i think that's the
sharp morality of the play that in it makes you look at the fact that we make monsters out of people but actually people are just
during the theater course is a story of imagination and the problem about people in life is it maybe a story of psychology or psychosis i don't think madea's about psychosis it may be that the the people that we read or hear about in the news are actually in medical or psychological difficulty madea
it's just an emotional difficulty that's the really horrible truth of it that she's not mad she does something so beyond rational and suitability that you might think she might be mad but that's a sort of cop out the worrying fact is that she's not mad that just within sanity she does this terrible thing and i think king lear is the same you know hamlet's the same these people aren't mad they're just in a
there had been when we were in ireland there had been a uh a case of a woman who had driven her car right up to a cliff to see that the tide was out with her children in it and therefore backed the car out again and went to another place i mean there people people become incredibly precise at these moments of suicidal murder of their children and because the thing is gruesomely pragmatic often and so there's there was endless incidents in the paper of of things that we looked at
in the end has to do it i don't think she she tries not to do it i mean that's the it's about somebody trying not to kill
because she loves them because it's all about love i mean the the thing is a fantastic exploration of sort of card hand about when you say i love you what are you saying you're saying if you leave me i will
you saying i love you and i won't mind if you leave me you know it's about the nature of adult
children are pawns in a lot of adult relationships and i think the myth of modern sentimental culture is that children are the basis of our society not at all human adult passion is the basis of our society and it's a much more dangerous um
the key to it too isn't it that in all love affairs there's possibly a lover and a beloved and one person loves the other just slightly more than the other and normally that
who are in the middle of parting and you they say complain about their spouse and say you know i'm going to leave him he's absolutely dreadful and you won't believe what he did last night and the chap turns up and they
uh uh very much how we play it but if he only came back for any of these terrible meetings and stayed it would be forgotten within a day so
but it's not her who's saying it that the audience as it were the chorus themselves is saying maybe this is worth
didn't think you know and that they they push it and they with retract which is really how we think cause we think in this thing that the greeks were inventing it so the dialectic of i think the maybe i will maybe i won't and twentieth century is full of
it's a big thing they get very excited if they have a cold one of them has a cold at the moment and he goes i might cough
fifth set of tennis in in in um in wimbledon or something every ball was being walloped you know
and people are saying very ordinary things you know i and and and yet they're saying them at such a pitch so
shout all you can that's all you can do i mean they people just are screaming at each other the stuff that you hear in the street when people are arguing so it is it's it's a catastrophe cause by the time we are halfway through it's only forty minutes into it and i can't believe how much we've got through already and then there's the the
and then you realize you're in the wrong play and you're trying where's the right play i think you if you take the time you can go up on these little avenues that are entirely wrong right i'm i'm very good at doing the wrong
vexation it has to be somewhat terribly uncomfortable you can't find any in the sort of pendulum swing of normality you won't find anything you have to find a terrible problem and each character as they come onto these plays carries an enormous problem somebody desperately wants a son somebody else desperately wants someone
screaming you you have to have to believe that the other person's action is interfering terribly with your life if you come on and think well i'll see how things are going today you just won't find it then it's it's um it's actually the basis probably of all great drama which
london has already existed before the before we the curtain opens and so a lot of what we have to do is our preparation is quite thorough so we do meet for an hour before
communicates with i think literally physical energy just the physical energy of the actors carrying the weight of that terrible story that just sits behind their heads if you don't bring that with you the
they're thinking about their own lives you have to think about that life more strongly than the audience is thinking about their life so that your imagination's
it's fantastic for us it's like a sort of dream is that you go on this little tour of america and suddenly you find yourself on broadway i mean none of packed winter
wondering whether the threat outside is in any way going to stop the threat being that the either the ira were now marauding the countryside or the
determined to check the couple in their career of inamity she went across to a window and
he's pressing in front of the open and empty countryside like an invasion the orange bright sky
melted against the brightness somewhere there was a sunset in which the mountain
dark had so gained the trees that lois turning back to the window was surprised at how light the room was day still coming in from the fields by the south window was stored in the mirrors in the sheen of the wallpaper till the room
sister lois and because no one answered or cared and the conversation went on without her she
you know lewis dancing with officers up and down the avenue and getting very angry
but then as richard would certainly say that was county carlow all over lady maynard came in arm in arm with lawrence her nephew and said they were all very punctual
as the english are in fact the wives of officers who come to
their elevated social status so suddenly they were mixing with the aristocracy where in england
but i wouldn't like to be a man such a fuss about doing things except lawrence but he's such a hog or to i to go to london ever been
by now noticed that he's been up at the house smiling every day for the last two months so she does make a designation
you know how i hate all this gossip in the garrison neighborhood that's something i must set right
my nieces and it becomes a good deal to our house but i do feel i ought to refute these stories about her oh said jo
david tested it oh yes he nodded and then rather
looked at her under his lashes but they they they don't to begin with the
and then think of the young man's career these early marriages ruined premieres
once we talk with your friend i know how much you young men take from each other i think it's a
he overruled this without comment simply by maintaining his attitude for all his physical lightness the vigor there was a quality in him
but so long to gerald in particular a vanity of approach to rudeness so long as she and i both knew the same thing
by next year light had possessed itself of the vacancy still with surprise next year the chestnuts and acorns pattered unheard on the

an extra day unreckoned had come to abortive birth that these things might
east to west of the sky tall with scarlet that the country itself was burning while to the north the
neck of the mountain before mount isabel was frightfully outlined the roads in a natural dusk ran
secretive or terrified not a tree brushed pale by the wind from the flames not a cabin pressed in despair to the bosom of the night not a gate too
the twisted remained swinging aghast as the last
the sound of the last car widened gave itself to the open and empty
and uh i was supposed to fly to houston texas to appear at the shamrock hotel which was big place with a separate pub where
you know that was one of the big stops you made was in houston at the shamrock hotel and uh my agent called and
and i said i don't wanna do a series i live in new york you know what just go down and meet the people i said well i gotta catch a plane out tonight you know to houston i open there tomorrow night
so he said well the promised they'll get you on the plane so i go down to paramount studios and i meet people that i had no idea who they were but sherwood
who created the brady bunch john rich one of the most known directors in television doug cramer
uh there were all these people sitting there and so they met me and they said well would you mind uh coming back later
fine come back and um we're on the star trek set
and they make me up in the star trek dressing room william shatner was in there not overly friendly i might add which i have razzed him about many times over the years but um they made me up i went back and did a a screen test not with robert reed with another actor
they thanked me very much i got on my plane got to houston later that night the next day rehearsed getting ready to go on stage for the first
oh my gosh well i went to the gentleman who ran the
the uh room at the hotel and i explained what the deal was and i said if this show becomes a hit
and make up this engagement so they let me out they got another entertainer i believe jerry vale came and filled in for me and um i went back did the pilot thought no more of it
didn't know there were people in the audience that were thinking about me for a role in song of norway
so wound up going to london shortly after that and doing the screen test for the song of norway to play edvard grieg's wife nina
lo and behold i got that so i'm over in norway which is something that was supposed to take a few weeks goes into months now the brady bunch has been picked up and they're getting ready to start the brady bunch they're screaming for me you know to leave the movie and it was really a chaotic time and i had to fly back go right to la and they had already shot around me for six episodes and so i had to catch up i was meeting myself coming and going
and um the rest is tv history i don't quite understand it
uh the cast which was the same on the pilot
i think sherwood spent hours and hours and hours and saw hundreds of kids for these roles i think one that that made it early was susan olsen
but i think they saw hundreds and hundreds of kids and my goodness what a stroke of luck that they wound up with those
kids because i think another reason why this show has lasted it was that initial chemistry of bob
and uh and everybody on that set was a pro from the beginning well i sure wish forrest could tell you cause i think he saw them all but he
you know so close to them he had such definite ideas about what they should do or shouldn't do and i think as they grew and they developed very definite ideas of their own i think sometimes that was very hard for
we had spent time uh together doing the pilot i think about two weeks as i recall and we kind of got to know each other then when i came back they they already had us had a head start on me but i think it was just
the idea that it worked in the pilot and it and it worked and we knew it worked
i think professionally we respected each other and it just kind of it kind of took off but as far as as having extra time we didn't we didn't have that luxury so we had to kind of do it as we were going along you know it was a work in progress and it was the time that we spent trying to rehearse a scene or preparing or having lunch together or
come over to my house or my kids would go to their houses those kinds of things that built up
didn't know any of them before shooting began i certainly knew of ann b davis's work and robert reed but i had never worked with anyone that um
knowing in the beginning their real names and their stations and i think someone told me this that on one of the episodes i think i call chris knight peter i
i mean i call him chris um i think it was i think it was uh chris knight but yeah that was hard just learning everybody's
i think one of the most talented people that i've ever worked
um when i first did the show they said oh well you know he doesn't like to rehearse he he he won't be there um you know kind of off the cuff but the more i did the show the more i realized even though he didn't come to rehearsal he knew
that was going on they made tapes for him of things um and you know you'd be singing a duet with him and you wouldn't see him till the day of the show but i realized just how how brilliant he was and what a great comedian he was and it's still one of the highlights of my career i think lena horne um kate smith and myself were his
but i just and again i mean choreographers like bob sidney
you know who's done so much television and so much incredible work as a choreographer you'd have all these incredible dancers and people to help you create these numbers and and do all of these incredible things and um greg garrison was the director very tough
um but he was always very nice to me as a matter of fact they built this huge number around me for one of the shows and kate smith was on the show
she said to to greg garrison um she said how long have you um known florence
you know uh i knew of her work and and but this is really the first time that that i've worked with her and um kate smith said well then how come she has all those chandeliers in her
to look down the back of her gown and she wore these huge gowns you know she was a big woman with this incredibly wonderful voice and
looked down the back of her dress he said did you read the label it says everlast and he was just always going on with with shtick you know but he would he would never hit you over the head with it and i don't know i loved working with him because
he would do spontaneous things and he loved if you were able to go with him
i thought he was always incredibly well prepared and he knew how much i like to rehearse i'm a rehearsal freak and um he gave me a picture of the two of us together
don't practice too much and he once said to me and i thought this was an interesting comment about television
television you don't wanna practice too much because then you might get
and i thought that was very interesting because what he was saying really was don't be afraid to make a mistake don't be afraid to be
and i think that's kind of good advice for for television unless you're doing news or historical things you know biographies whatever
but dean martin was such a highlight to me dean would come in the day of the show and
you kind of go through things just kind of marking it and then you'd have a dress rehearsal which they film and greg hersch would always stand in for
you know so that i guess he would translate to dean what was supposed to be done and
you'd have a great dress rehearsal sometimes they were almost better and they would always film those in case they i guess they wanted to edit go back and forth and then you would do the actual
uh once i i broke a bone in my foot i was doing a backflip off a guy's back one of the dancers and landed real hard on my foot and uh my foot all swelled up and during the number i was doing with dean my shoe popped off that's how swollen my foot became and somehow he he took a step and we wound up on the floor it was like a double pratfall both laughing hysterically turned out to be incredibly
and i think it's still on the table he said oh poor
got a a broken toe or something like that but those were moments you know when you worked with somebody like dean martin
uh i think ever since i was eighteen i used to i mean when we were filming troy we were um we were filming down in cabo mexico for uh about two or three months of it and they had this one karaoke joint called what's up karaoke and a bunch of the cast would go down there every single night to um to
and and it was basically so repetitive everybody sang the sangs the same songs every night and yeah mine was always like better man by pearl jam or something my buddy was always
for a real audience and um i man um well troy was my first um acting gig you know in terms of really performing for for an audience for was really
country strong i mean we'd have five hundred to a thousand people in the audiences there and and that was that was kinda the the the the first of that besides you know your your late night crew at some
oh man um do you know uh family helps
and so that really helps because when you go home at the end of the day or you're on the phone with them nothing you know it's interesting
you know um me expressing my excitement from where i've come and and where i'm going and and you realize that it's it's important to you but it's it's not everybody else's first and foremost priority and so having a grounded family helps you be remain grounded uh
that's that's a good help good friends to to keep you in check stuff like
um no working with tim was definitely i've worked with him like three times now i mean in the inbetween friday night lights country strong and and you know our infamous truck yeah video
he was mad uh with him and i wheeling around the trucks but it's it's funny i was telling somebody this story the other day just kinda uh you know looking back on on the past and and and
how you know uh i was the biggest fan of tim and and how we've come to work with each other so many times and how great our kind of friendship is i think in terms of
duff are just so talented and i've got to meet them through this process and the the concert that we had in new york where it was like uh jack wyatt and
and folks like that all came down uh conor oberst uh oscar performed um this film has uh
terms of the musical company that that the coens had put together as well as as t bone so it
um a wonderful book called unbroken that that i'm i'm sure many people are a fan of so um i hope it's wonderful and as inspiring as the
that if he's gonna help hook get off this island and fly him to home a home to which he can't remember then he must help peter find his mother and and hook agrees to this but in no way really
ship he his selfish sort of exterior comes out uh full fleshed and and you really see
uh you really see his true colors but then there are tidbits and and also the interesting bit is about this film is the original j
one little line that said hook learned his ways from blackbeard and so we
moments tried to add little blackbeardisms into it knowing that i mean obviously this was a young
that that sort of was having a budding relationship with tiger lily and was having this kind of back and forth kinship with peter was slowly sort of showing
us this um much more you know black beardian uh villainous side
from the moment i met him has been swooning every
and younger girls hearts that i've ever uh uh seen him encounter um
um he's the most charming young boy i've ever met uh he really is peter pan in a way i mean although he's not quite as selfish as peter pan's depicted to be in in a lot of the versions he
he's brilliant actor and what he did with this film is brilliant and how he holds himself is brilliant and how he handles these press junkets is brilliant and and i think i've learned half my
and flamboyant and over the top and when joe asked me to do this he'd said you know imagine that neverland is just a figment of a child's imagination so there are no rules and
um and surprise us and the more we
wwe were having and the more fun joe was having and especially with these sets being so massive and i think
the neverland forest set was the one of the biggest sets the uk had ever built
and it would be two hundred extras dressed as natives and it'd be you know two hundred cast members and a ugandan children's choir and levi as an eleven year old wide eyed first experience like this um dancing around on these sets because joe'd be playing music and everybody's acting childish and ridiculous and we realized that every every film should really
pow camp which um which laid out their their whole
it's in in their uh experience of punishment and sort of everything and uh laura hillenbrand had sent this diary over to me which
of years before um um uh we found ourselves on set making this movie uh
so from from years and years of watching everything i could online or reading every story that'd been written about him the day uh when it came to the day that i was to arrive at his house
angie told me to not come empty handed so i went shopping i brought this box of
me it that seemed like the sort of traditional thing that that my
um and and sort of sitting there yeah it's um it it was very surreal but
some of the stuff on the raft first you may see it it starts
uh trying to skype with my family and saying happy turkey day while he got
it is but it's you know it's all worth it the the amount of of pain we could have went through
percentage of what these guys had went through they'd lost more than half their body weight um most
we were so inspired by this story and it moved us so much that i don't think with any of the guys there was a limit to where we would've went you know only maybe just uh it would've
grumpy when the deprivation of everything that you're comfortable with gets a little irritating i mean i remember when i was a kid wrestling you go to the lunchroom and some kid's sitting over there and he's like look my snack pack is so good
patience i have none in life but i have it when i make a movie you
make a movie you wanna wake it and you adjust you gotta be open a lot of people lock in to certain things i never lock
see what happens and i love uh actors so the stars and i have a good time and uh we uh make a movie
no i make room see i'm very adjustable if it offends no we we uh we have parts and we say
so and so you want to come do it if they say no we we have also uh newer actors i i i don't just uh use old actors what we have some new kids cause i like to find kids and uh there's a a
he and i think scotty shot a a a blond girl and uh there's always uh this kid abby breslin's great i had uh taught since she's six and jake austin's very good so i get new new kids and all the new teenagers and we try to find people who are going and for the first time she did a movie this kid was great this lea michele i know she did tv but she's very busy
wish i had her in happy days the musical which i did in toronto you know where happy days musical now is in
yes in many ways uh i uh was drunk and missed one years ago i was i don't know what year it was even but uh i
i asked my wife to get married one new year's eve uh because i wasn't working usually i work as a drummer but i wasn't and uh
easy for me we got married on her birthday so i'd only have to remember one date
yes she has one or two lines that's it and always plays a nurse that's her
and i love uh actors so the stars and i have a good time and uh we uh make a
and uh she was uh a little uh intimidated this time cause she was working with three oscar winners and she but she they all after the they all you know when you're a real nurse they all say listen barbara my arm hurts here and she's now nursing in the middle of my movie but uh we we we have a good time and i i worked with a lot of actors i never worked with in this movie so it was really fun for
de niro could knock your socks off quite often and have a good time i thought the uh they're all great but of course the the there surprise is i had worked with michelle pfeiffer before and and suddenly she wanted to play a
kind of this kind of a uh obviously an invisible woman who's very you never notice her and she did such a great job and i had uh this kid i knew uh sing and dance zac efron but uh i said that's how i got him to come i said you don't have to sing and dance you gotta act how about that why not we can do that and he said sure and he
hippie kid and that's where i worked with he's we're different generations zach and i so he says things
uh i could open a restaurant or write a book i chose to write the my daughter lori is a graduate of uh northwestern journalism school and where i graduated and she writes it with me and it's about uh my personal life and working with all these people through the years i've been doing it a few years you know so uh all the people i've met and all the different uh you know not
uh anecdotes and uh it it's there's no tell all in that kinda book but it it's kind of uh uh fun for me because uh i can talk about it and thank people uh in a funny way of course it's a comedy and uh sometimes in an emotional way
i had an i had cancer and i was a survivor and how i got through all that and the people who helped me so uh i think it's a very emotional
uh i hope uh you know people people read it it's called uh my happy days in
well i say well we'll get her a job and uh mostly all my shows after happy days came because happy days was such
a nice group of people they were so happy they were working they had lives
so that allowed you to bring in guest stars so we were stuck one episode
uh lowell ganz and mark rothman had written an episode for some other show that they didn't buy
and you know i have a very good memory's always helped me and a year went by and i said
you guys have a half a good episode we're stuck with it we didn't have a script for two weeks from then they said that half was good wasn't this about guys picking up girls in supermarkets by making them believe they couldn't get stuff off the shelf was it i do that myself it used to work with
they looked for girls then finally fonzie fixes them up with two girls from the other side of the tracks which was also from my experience when i was a musician i dated some odd ladies
um you know well i i i guess the whole stemming of laverne and shirley was from then you gotta take it from me like we took these two girls out and we walked them to some diner at three o'clock in the morning
then the girl said it again and i i think my date said hold my coat gave me her coat and took the girl out her with her punched her in the head and the other girl and they were killing it four girls beating each other up while me and my friend stood like this and i was didn't know what to do
that's where we should do we'll get two girls like that never saw those girls again i was glad to get out of there the police came it was quite embarrassing but
that's where we got those two girls from and we named them laverne and shirley and then they came on happy days and uh everybody immediately saw that as a spin off fred silver was then in his spin off days and uh
just in conversation but i met him at some convention and he said what do you got i said i got nothing i'm not i'm busy he says you must got something that makes
a girl they were all in laverne and shirley everybody likes him we brought him on four times what's it about eh i said i i can see you're a big watcher of my show
says oh yeah girls from the other side of the tracks i said i like
tv there's no blue collar girls in the world there's nothing happening there said i love it it's on what's it's name laverne and shirley good let's buy laverne and shirley never saw it never saw a script never saw a episode bought said we're gonna do it go make it and uh i made a little
uh it was ten minutes long after people were spending hundreds of thousands he took this ten minute little thing that we shot at the end of a happy days episode and he sold it and it they bought it immediately and it was laverne and shirley because of the fact that there was no blue collar girls debuted number one in the ratings it was opened number one because they were dying for somebody
didn't look like mary tyler moore or all the pretty girls on tv they were somebody who looked like a regular person and these two my sister looks like a regular person talks like a regular person and cindy williams was
but in my opinion it's the hardest job in the world is a mother raising a teenager these days it's a toughie with that internet
look up is a major thing i have grandchildren they look up occasionally if there's ice cream they look up but i i think it was time to celebrate it and not so much oh i'll do another holiday as uh do something about mothers and how hard it is and how they have to put up with
how that makes them happy and she said that when i was six
she said don't be boring i think at seven or eight i said i don't know what is
i knew my father wasn't foreign but was not so fondly my father but he was a great boss and that's truly why penny ronnie and i were all up
well i try to convey that i will not really win you an academy award but i will make you have a really good time doing the movie and you'll make friends
you'll uh it'll be a different experience and they come because they like to do once in a while something that's a different thing than the usual movie and i won't blow them up i won't make them fly they won't have to do green screen there'll actually be another actor talking to them
because my rule is you must do off camera for each other and they all do and uh they i hope
that is because they have a good time most of them had said that uh
part of show business he went in cause i lectured at northwestern but she was so uh nice
and uh not only in movies but uh i had a uh how do the commercials she does i can't shoot they shoot it in four days i shoot in an hour but we did good and i loved how prepared she was and how she was ready to try this that and all the ways and was not
in in friends they you know i've done tv you gotta do this this but here we could just go and she really impressed me in the
sister everybody knows my sister penny but i said i had the best time with jennifer she was so good and made the scenes come alive because she has a way of doing it not like a female male or anything just like
well weekend actually i i just arrived on thursday and am leaving tomorrow
it was better than i had even anticipated i was excited to come home uh particularly since i'm bringing my five month old
it was his first time to see ohio i had him breathe that ohio air that wonderful akron cuyahoga
and it was exciting you know i don't think he uh he grasped the significance of it but um he was more interested in the carrots but i i i i
fifteen years and uh my mother is very active in the akron woman's city club she's the
someone who's who's worked with the coach house theatre which is one of the theaters where i i i got my start at and the coach house theatre so it's been a wonderful wonderful trip back it's made me wanna come back more often which i have promised i yeah
oh god no i you know we're always asked if some of the the greatest ones always escape you at the
i would say most of the joking around on the set involves um quips
we're making we're making fun of the scene before we do it because it just sort of breaks the tension and we do all sorts of things
with each other's off the set as well uh i don't know uh i mean there
uh i think we should just sort of keep to ourselves but believe me trust me they're funny they were very
uh we went actually we went both to the stowe one and to the original
a trip no that's great i i didn't make it to skyway which is that's another favorite during the those high school years that was one of my favorites and i didn't make it to stoddard's frozen custard which i don't even know if that's
she was a great influence in my life uh she probably doesn't know this but she actually was somebody who trusted me a great deal i she used to read to
person called poppy and uh i was mesmerized by the story and i just couldn't wait to hear it the next day and she let me take
home overnight which was a complete secret no one else was you
granted this privilege and i was so nervous about losing the book but she she really trusted me uh which which probably took a lot of courage on her part and uh uh i just remember how terrific i thought she was and she was the one that uh uh that
i told her i'd danced in a beer joint and won five bucks which uh actually was true but it wasn't quite
uh i had won you know five or seven dollars or something doing a tap dance and singing a song
uh i don't know if she'll be back again i don't know if anything's happening this year again uh not that not to my knowledge but
continues our relationship we we haven't had as many scenes as we would like together in that way so we're hoping that there's some episode this year that will happen we'll um we both have requested that
tap dancing when i was four or five and i've done it for a long time i love it brent could do a few steps on his own and so i knew what those steps were and tried to choreograph in a way that would uh
sort of work those steps into it and then we also had a a a double at at another point um it was a lot of fun and we got to work on the scene together and and sort of play around with some of the the lines and the comic timing it was a
and in certain ways i'm sure it will change and i'm i'm sure he would have wanted that if he were still at the helm it would change and
oh no i i i love i do love watching the medical stuff because it's
you know he when he when uh we've had a few opportunities to spend a little time together deforest and
are so they're much smaller and there's there are less of them there are so many props now in the in uh beverly's medical bay i'd love to have seen the difference of the
wondered about that nobody has ever you know allowed me to pin them down but i've always thought so i
so much fun working with somebody who already knows all of our idiosyncrasies and and we're just very comfortable with him
if you're familiar with the sets as we all are if we're on them every day it helps to come up with your ideas of how you were gonna shoot something and it went very
and and i don't remember it at all um until sort of when it was reruns and things like that and i knew the show and i knew that there was a
and i knew that um spock was the only name i knew i actually didn't know enough to actually it was
new york primarily when i'm not working out there and uh
an understanding of the phenomenon i didn't realize so uh uh there was no huge impact like oh my
play with linda hunt that i really wanted to do and so when i got there i turned down star trek actually
i thought well alright so i came back to new york and actually had a great year i did a a david williamson play loved doing it in fact a friend of mine was filming in the studio somewhere else who was in the
at nyu and the fans meanwhile were writing all these letters of support and so i thought you know i
autographs on an index card but they're really saying we really liked your work i can't believe
so wonderful so i and i would get them from children and adults every um age range and
happens some of these people um i know they get really bad press because of like i think
then and on certain level there are some people who are obsessive about it
some club and and they have a ball they have a costume party they're having halloween every time they ever do this you know so actually i don't
yeah really just what she wants i know um i don't know i guess it's not as doctorally
like i did a play out in los angeles where i could use my own hair it sort of changes uh
i don't mind um it's a tradeoff this way i'm not recognized all the time which is which is
funny show it's uh slightly dirty but um you don't really see
because if you go too much one way it becomes too camp or kind of off putting and if you go too much the other way it can just be naturalistic and
you know moliere whatever but if you can find that line it's very clownesque and we had a
you know and this uh you know all of them really i don't have there's no favorite i just uh i love them and i love my two
they were former students of mine i adore them i think that they're people who also make films they're actors they they are in our affiliates
you know cause in a relationship it starts out with a couple and they're blaming each other and then it turns out they're actually able to because they've changed in some way themselves they're able to see and appreciate the other person which is a very standard sort of thing except that how this
uh well i'm a choreographer as well as a director and um
but that they don't go in and go oh i'm comfortable here and this is my seat and everything's gonna happen here that it could happen right next to you it could happen around you and not in a way that you're gonna have to be you know get
a pie thrown in your face but in a way of just not knowing what's gonna happen next
i like films where i don't know what's happening next i like theater where i don't know what's happening
so that's kind of cool to me and one of the things that i try to do when i
could happen right next to you it could happen around you and not in a way that you're going to have to be you know get
a pie thrown in your face but in a way of just not knowing what's gonna happen next
i like films where i don't know what's happening next i like theater where i don't know what's happening
black box because of that you can put the chairs anyway you can have the audience in the middle and everything happening around them i like the
the audience can get disoriented in a positive way you don't go in there with your head in the program and just okay this is what this is
i mean it's nobody makes money or but we most of the people are
houses with an eighty piece orchestra and we did the acting in between
tell you how many people loved it and said they had never ever gone to any kind of theater or
it's popular so hey if you wanna support
the the theater out here we have shows of all different kinds but there
it's really there's so much happening here now and we're struggling all of the theater companies because it's such a spread out city it makes it much tougher but i really feel if we can get
connected in terms of the people who are doing it the like i'm really game to put
do um a series of shorts here or have people be
uh rogue theater machine rogue artists there's a lot of amazing
not all of them do brand new work but a lot of them do and uh
yeah he at first was just producing it and there were actually a a few sets of thelmas and louise before it actually became susan and i uh because he went through a few different directors and then decided i'm just gonna direct this myself
should play louise that this would be a fantastic turning point that i'd play the more mature part and
i i wanted this so bad and i'm just pitching my heart out and i brought all my notes and everything about why i absolutely have to be louise
for i said you know what's so weird is i've been listening to myself as i
cause you're out in the middle of the desert or something so we're just hanging
loves movies and loved this script um but i think it was just
but he didn't and immediately wanted to do it himself it was a low budget movie he's used to doing great you know great big things um it was something a eighteen million dollar budget um and and he was gonna have someone else do it but
but because uh he gave it the epic sweep that it has which
um it i think it could have seemed like a much smaller movie but you know with his
uh and at the same time was incredibly collaborative and freewheeling the the the thing i noticed have learned the most about directors is when they're very confident in themselves they're open to creativity from other people if they're
or nervous then they shut off and nobody's ideas are don't even tell the me your ideas just do it the way i want you to do it and it's not the best with somebody like sydney
you know the guy with the delivering the hot dogs says can i say
then i heard that they can like boo and throw things at the screen if they don't like a movie they they
two women who uh are just sort of normal small town uh women from arkansas and
in uh some serious trouble and become desperados you know i i i actually wrote that because
is a uh a housewife who's led a extremely sheltered life i i've only gone out with one person um and uh married my sort of high school sweetheart who's who's uh pretty much of a of
uh shye had really never left this town and then we go on this uh
ends up stealing all their money they have sixty seven hundred dollars with him and he he steals all the money but you know i i sort of feel like it's
sort of mid uh way uh in our transformation we've uh we've gotten in a lot of trouble
and there's kind of a snowball effect going on and we we decided we're gonna to try to flee to mexico and and this is us trying to
i think so you know i'm not as uh not as extreme and i and i've never gone to the other extreme i haven't held up liquor stores
laughs really hard and i could get her in trouble if i could get her to laugh so i had
and then shut my mouth and she says bah laughing and gets thrown out of
i i um i i tried to it's hard work you know the only i ever actually finished um was an episode of of this tv show
it came rather easily in fact uh actually veni had been to
this this present for a while before before we met uh but then it it actually started all coming
but in lots of really fun ways we watched a million pirate movies and we read every book about pirates and also i had uh very extensive training uh for the kinds of stunts that i was gonna have to do i had six months of fencing lessons and horseback riding and swimming
and i do everything you can possibly think of in this movie i have scenes underwater
but it's it's not dangerous i know it's not dangerous because we have
people and stunt coordinators and everything is very well planned but yet you're you're very uh you're very excited because it it still feels like something
actually there were female pirates and uh and they were actually quite famous and and quite
were uh the i guess the most famous female pirates were anne bonny and mary
uh what i have you know i i think we imply that i've had a lot of love
and uh i start falling for the slave i buy played by matthew modine and why wouldn't i he's so
uh and also i think he's just so captivating in the movie it's really charming and looks like like errol
terrifying i'm actually uh afraid of heights too so
it's not so i have to just act strong and i have to
being together we love working together and we both really love the movie so it was it was actually really inspiring to be able to
to to do a movie like this is you have to be very uh you have to have a lot of endurance
because even though it's really fun it's long hours and you have to do a lot of takes and it's
it can be very strenuous and then you finish a scene one day that was very difficult and then you realize what tomorrow
believe the things that i was doing but uh but rinny really believes that uh the most fun people can have watching a movie is is they can tell that it's really the actor so
i am doing another action picture with him i'm gonna start shooting it in just a few weeks in fact it's called the long kiss goodnight and we're
it and you have no control over what it is that's gonna turn out in the end
you know i need to learn about acting before i can even think about directing and especially like getting someone to to listen to me and go okay i'm gonna listen to your direction so everything i mean i love acting and it's i really have a passion for it i think i will always want to do it but um
i suppose we have such a great culture for it and it's it's something that's like cultivated as
i knew people wanted to put you in a box i didn't put myself in a box but other people
yeah i i really liked i really liked strawberry fields i thought she was fun i thought she was witty um
to get a a job at that point in my career because i was a student had a lot of student debt i was a
you know if i continue to play those kind of roles all the time then yeah you limit yourself but if you if you
is that the surprise element the um i never know i don't have any aspirations of i want to play this role i want to play that role i love it when i get sent something or
and change things all the time everyone can just get on with their job and if you get the right cameraman
in a unique fresh tone and it's all many different genres of film in one film and if i think if anybody else maybe tried to direct it it could've gone horribly wrong and it's masterfully done and very subtly done by
you become more you know you have under more scrutiny and then you scrutinize yourself more it becomes harder i've seen tamara drewe like
for myself it doesn't really do anything cause you take it's never gonna be
when they were young and when i was younger i wasn't i wasn't really aware of bodies and being attractive and i was sort of more interested in in doing my plays and and reading and i i don't know i've i just didn't have that kind of power i suppose it you know that sexual prowess that tamara has um so and uh yeah i kind of relate to that and but tamara the reason i played tamara is because i didn't relate to
and i i wanted to work out why she does the things she does i i just found her interesting and because she's so different to me
um and yeah so i've really had to i based her a lot on people that i've
in life and i found it to be a very honest and real representation of a modern woman the things that she faces
the fact that she's imperfect the fact that we never actually get her
actually people are very supportive but um i believe it's quite exposing cause they know you from before so you can't be anything
i don't know i think the interesting thing about the cosmetic surgery thing in this film is that yeah it's easy enough to go and have it done but the way it makes you feel afterwards tamara can't deal with it she can't deal with the fact that people relate to her in a different way and and she feels that she's lost actually something
something this respect for her sort of changed and she and i thought that was really interesting because there's such a cosmetic surgery's becoming
the repercussions of it is interesting i think it's good that we spoke
yeah i mean she she fills the void um she doesn't have anyone in her life that actually loves her and and she she really really wants to be cherished um at the end of the day that's why she she looks for all these men and they sort of fulfill her slightly and but
the end of the day she doesn't really get get what she wants she doesn't know what she wants even at the end of
i uh you know that imperfection is perfection i
you know the center point is a woman who's sort of not necessarily a showy character or um
just her it's quite sort of um gentle um
and funnily enough for katerine i don't think she's aware of it i think at that time i think people just kind of accepted then when we hadn't had that second wave we hadn't had the feminist movement yet and so it was sort of the we were in the in the nineteen forties you were kind of
just kind of got on with it i imagine i would imagine um and what i like about is
she is a feminist and she doesn't know it yet she just sort of within that circumstance was sort of
being pushed into so it certain sudden situations where she ends up putting her point down but um and i like that about this film is that it has a message but it's not it's very very underneath and it doesn't sort of shout about it it's just there
so i mean constructing a film and and
you know propaganda film making so it had to be a certain way and even though you know making films now they can't necessarily make what you want to make you have to kind of make them around certain
things like that but yeah it's a it's an incredible uh an incredibly detailed process that i often just before didn't realize how difficult it was
proud of this film and i feel like it's a it's a it's it's so wonderful to show it here i mean tonight we've we've got sadiq kahn sort of
it's a it's a real love letter to london and and and how how wonderful it is and how wonderfully diverse a culture it is and and what we can do here and the and the spirit of uh london so yeah to show it show it here is really exciting and i think it's sort of it's very hopeful and very
yeah but i think that's the for me i i mean my taste in cinema is is quite bizarre and um sometimes i like to be completely disturbed by films but this was is not disturbing it makes you feel uh it makes you feel happy and it reminds you that you might even feel emotion sometimes um so yeah it's it's i'm very proud of it
the building on fire she sees smoke um she sees priya you know reacting to it and um her first instinct is to run in and and see if anyone's hurt if anyone needs help um it was kind of good cause she's just kinda fearless in that moment so it was nice to see the kind of heroine side of her
filming oh it was brilliant i mean the fact that when when we read the script uh we were all thrilled and then when we knew we had neil directing it he was like you're gonna be doing it
stunt yourself um but we're all fireproofed up um and it was it was done so professionally and and everyone was just really good on set you know everyone kinda knew on that day we'd have to knuckle down that bit harder um and
long as the viewers enjoy it then um kind of you just kind of put your work in and hope hope
it was a little bit of both really i had a cold when we filmed it so that didn't help um but i had to do lots of shouting lots of kind of get in grab me
a voice for about three days so i think around the episode you'll kind of see carli kind of in and out of sounding like sylvester
i'm i'm not sure it's obviously a smoke machine um but the had so we brought guys in um like professional kind of guys from films and uh it was amazing really the amount of people who were on set normally you walk on set and there's about you know ten twelve people but there was like over twenty um we had five firemen in there um obviously lighting the fires putting them out
no i did it all myself i kind of when they said you have to lift uh i have to lift john i was like oh it's fine you know i can lift more in the gym so it kind of works so all the gym work came in
um because you think it will make him too muscular but we've nowhere near
love and some of it very shocked um but yeah it's kind of a will they won't they at the minute um with kylie coming up with someone
she's ready to meet someone but it's whether or not they kinda go together in that way or if the two go to friends or if the you know there's anything else involved um so
hollyoaks was very fast paced a really quick turnaround so that you had to be on the ball with your lines and you know it's the same here
yes my one of my best friends from holly oaks makayla dodge she played in chloe she's actually having a baby soon um so yeah i'm gonna be hopefully seeing more of makayla um played
you know i i said that as soon as i came i said to him he needs to come back just because it'd be brilliant to work with him um but yeah i think he's he's gotten another job now so
like her and then i think they'll they'll find her quite funny and then eventually feel sorry for her and hopefully she'll come
it was brilliant i mean working out in the states was it was daunting um thankfully i only did um the voiceover stuff in the states for the film the film was an american movie but it was filmed in russia for nine weeks um and then when we when we wrapped the film and we had to go over to la to do um all the sound effects and it was quite funny because i was in in my booth doing my voiceover stuff and i looked to the left and in the next booth it was will ferrell
difference being able to go home after a day's work um
i mean for three years i used to film and then go back to the hotel the same hotel with the same food menu and the the staff were
boyfriend and i'm close to my family so it's nice to go home and see them i just realize i said dog before boyfriend which genuinely is the order it is i miss my dog more than my fella
got you know great friends and learnt so much about the industry and you know how it
you know the the milestones you know coming of age and stuff um when i was starting out there was always the invite to
me and i'm it's kind of it's nice to just surround yourself with those people who who you know have got your best interest at heart and
four girlfriends from berry you know a lot of mates and acquaintances but my four girlfriends
in front of my friends and family so it'll be quite tough uh we start rehearsals on the seventeenth of uh november
they basically got me in a harness the whole time um which i'll let everyone know it i look quite fat in the harness it's not my body it's the harness they fit it underneath my costume and i have to
and it killed me my hip bones are killing my shoulders cause it it's like a parachute it's so heavy but they've assured me the safety guys that
know i thought well on the day they'll just do it again but then with the peter pan script if i see a line like that i think about no you have to learn it now because there's no retake on the day so i think it's a lot more work but i think once you get on stage and the adrenaline will start pumping and i think you can just have a laugh with it really uh it should be
give me great advice but i do i do miss hollyoaks i mean i still watch it whenever i can
yeah i'm in the new uh command and conquer red alert three i play lieutenant eva mckenna so i'm the
and the commanders who knew the player uh we shot it in a studio in la which was fab uh jenny mccarthy's in it autumn reeser from the
um tim curry's in it there's amazing big names in it and i thought it'd be blue screen me computerized but it's me as you'd see
they've managed to combine the film and the computer game uh but it's out now uh i think it's out for the xbox on the fourteenth of december um but it's uh it's a very good game i advise everyone
and south africa and did a show over there and then the panther came up so i was doing this thing
acting fifty percent singing i need to do a hundred percent into one thing um so she completely agreed to meet we put the singing on hold to nail down all the acting and then next year the producers are still willing to
spice girls to me was like a marriage it was a marriage where i fell in
what can i say like one in three marriages these days and we were babies when we started i was the eldest i was twenty two um under the you know pressures of work schedules you know that marriage it broke up
well i did i counted all in all the other day and it's about forty different kind of jobs but um before i met the spice girls i i was trying to put a demo tape together which cost three hundred pounds and um i was trying to be the
well i did have to say the odd word and um
it certainly came back to haunt me yeah totally um you know
and um i remember asking someone in the record business i said what do
you know we had we had good gut instinct that it was gonna work really and it was you know it was a tight thing
it's so fast you've gotta understand really we were only in the public eye two years but i mean that's the state of consumerism it's so
had a big learning experience from that if anyone is suffering from constipation sing to prince charles cause i went
if i fell over what would i do what would i do so i came to this plan that if i did fall over i was just gonna
water rafting and i fell in water uh in the in the rapids got
put your mind to something and you feel strong then then you can achieve anything
thirty in my bed in my nice flannel like pajamas and there is a bomb scare in my hotel and i have they say madam you have to get
i was um when i was eighteen years old and i was busy being a club dancer and i had to pay my rent i had a lump in my breast and i thought oh
book um by ruth picardie uh before i say goodbye and i swear to you i read this book and i
you know i'd like to say i don't discredit it you know what what what we achieve together you know i i thank the spice girls and all the fans with without
a massive learning experience for me you know spiritually mentally i my mind grew a hundred years you know in so many
but's that um i just there was you know the day that i left the spice girls um and i
uh it made me check out my principles actually i was meant to be in this studio doing the
all into lyrics my album so just before christmas i sketched all the songs and i'm mastering them now so what you're gonna have is this album that's
well during it i didn't wanna analyze myself during you would be self conscious and then for the first time i picked up one of their copies of the disc and thought shit is it
really taught me a lesson so i can never say never you know
that encouragement and girl power if you wanna call it that has existed
and encouraging young women and girls you know to believe in
and so if that ignites a new generation fantastic to go out and you know become
you know what it took me a real you know it's only it's taken me a few months to wind down from it um
cause prior to that i was you know writing my books and then i made sure i finished the deadline just before i
off the tour i i was kind of gearing up to start promoting my book and that's quite
high speed and you suddenly stop it takes you awhile to suddenly go oh and actually this week
irony of this is that i wrote these i wrote about eugenia way before i knew that a spice
wanted to create a character that was like a rebirth of girl power so i thought how can i reach the next generation and i love
i feel really proud of what we did but i i kind of think that everything is has it's time i'd part of me is kind of a little bit
it was it was fun we were young and you know i've moved on and once you become a solo artist you know i've learned to be a solo artist
uh i never say never but at the moment no not at the moment i'm you know i'm i i like
i think i'm the i'm proud to say that i'm the only one that's got the original record contract which in this day and
the deal it still got me it's a great relationship i have with him and you know i still have a career i'm on my third soda album which is
to be honest i've really tried not to i we all go through different stages in life and i i really
women and men out there that go through that struggle you know of kind of finding themselves of of feeling comfortable and for me it's been a journey of just feeling
for me i'm i really i'm not interesting whether you know
for my to myself i've i've never dieted for a video you know in the
three meals a day a lot of cardiovascular you know really kind of vigilant with that and now i've just kind of eased
they are they are considerations but actually um i think it's one of those things that i have to
live my life in a box just in case that person turns out to be it's like we all
with someone whether they're good looking famous rich and it's just you and another person in a
well it is kind of it's that industry that's breeding you know that
with people where you just kinda you're in a room and you know just out of kind of um politeness you kind of uh give
i mean there's all different ways of writing i've gone in from scratch just with a melody and
i i i do now because i had a um nodules and i quite smoking a year ago so now i can sing live but i was always
well i've done it a little bit but i've just really gone for it because i you know if i'm gonna be uh an artist a serious artist for and stand you know as a live performer i
play judy hopps she is a bunny cop she is the first bunny cop on the police force of zootopia which has been up until this point um comprised completely of
i think that i am as animated in real life as most of the things that disney puts on a screen
in animated form uh i think judy and i are both fiercely optimistic and idealistic and a little bit self righteous we're both tryers
is is a a sly slick fox who uh hustles in zootopia he believes very strongly that you are what you are and you cannot break out of the preconceived notions that are put upon you based just purely on the animal that you're born into being and uh judy has to team up with nick as she gets no help from anyone else on the police force uh she has to team up with
in the very beginning of the film there are fourteen missing mammals in zooptopia um judy is not put on a missing mammals case she's actually meter maid but she volunteers uh to the wife of a missing otter to help find the missing otter and she because she gets no help she asks this conman with whom she's crossed paths a couple times nick fox nick wild um to help her solve the case uh because he actually
and predator all live together in harmony that of course doesn't end up being the case but it is a land where it's a land made up of several different lands of four different lands where the physical habitations um are appropriate for each species of animal it's a place where they can all live and get
not gonna lie it's a cushy job i mean i could definitely do this forever i go in in my pjs i bounce around all day i don't have to worry about makeup um
there is something really really liberating about only having your voice to express a character and i never realized before getting involved in animation how much i rely on my face and my body language and even costumes in order to help express who a character is and to only be left with your voice is really
definitely think he'll recognized mom's voice uh i will definitely show him the movie i think i might wait on zootopia until he understands that what he's seeing on screen isn't real because right now anything he might see i mean winnie the pooh exists to him in the world and so i don't want to ruin that experience for him in his realizing that well if judy hopps is really mom then judy hopps isn't really a being that i could you know be
this movie cause it's hilarious uh because it does pack that surprise emotional punch that we all believe going into the the movies they're not gonna affect us cause
way through because something's incredibly relatable um it's an action movie it's a homage to hollywood cinema and wonderful tv shows i mean it really it's one of those it really does
well yesterday i swished with listerine
cause little did i know oral disease is the number one
and i learned about all of the values of swishing with listerine you know brushing
i'm i'm all about preventing oral disease since nearly half of adults suffer
day um recently i've been using extra virgin organic coconut
oh yeah i use it everywhere for everything and i cook with it so there's jars of it all over my house
um and keeping up with it and then i i i personally embraced by bed head and i
super curly i actually tweeted a picture recently of my hair
just try it you can always grow it out not that growing out hair is at all pleasant but you know there's hats there are scarves and i think ultimately people will uh discover
all of it um i'm very careful about what i eat i believe in um indulging don't get me wrong
i do pilates i uh i dance i love ballet i do yoga but i don't over work out i'm not um
i can tell you that we're about to explore more of snow white's childhood we're
we have some more uh some new cast members joining us rose mcgowan joined us um leslie nicol of downton abbey fame joined us um bailey madison of course returns to play
gonna have some some issues growing up having heard while in utero all kinds of things about
perfect i mean it was we had it was a last minute kind of thing because we thought of ourselves as exceptionally modern and we were like we don't need to get married we'll get married later and then i was nine months pregnant and we were like we totally need to get married so at nine months we invited like maybe twenty five people and i was so big my girlfriend monique lilly had designed my dress and i was in the fitting and i was like i
different name for like six months and both woke up one day and said we just have a feeling that's not gonna be right and oliver wasn't based on anything it was just a name that we adored and there were no family members you know unfortunately uh being honored and it wasn't a literary reference but we were actually all sitting around with my family one day as everyone flew in to wait for me to go into labor which has its pros and cons
dollars to anyone who can guess the baby's name on the first try but we're not
tell you we're not gonna tell you today if you guessed it and my little sister said
i i mean there were not clues given she just guessed she just knows me that well i guess well i don't really have to give her five
i gave birth the whole family came in and josh pulled out a check and
and uh the charmings or the charmsteins as we call ourselves cause we're jewish uh
the plans aren't in this particular situation necessarily wholesome and and the only other time we've seen snow white go dark she was cursed and i will say that this dark secret is uh is based on true
i'm literally just hopping around like a sound booth making as you'll see animal
duper pregnant i mean if i recorded this for three years when i was super pregnant um they'd asked about my coming in for a
please let me come in please let me come in and i got to work and they had set up for
would it would close the door for anyone else to understand so it's important to leave it broad enough to be understood and yet private enough to
i think writing songs every time you finish a song every time you say that song is done you you've
starting songs is the easy is the easy part it's easy to sort of get a chord and maybe one line and but it's finishing a song and saying now i've i've said what i need to say it's wrapped up it's done that's when you real realize how much you've learned in the process and i think it's very important to finish songs even if they're not good songs sometimes it's important just to finish it as an exercise as an intellectual exercise to say okay so this song has been
a little ghost in my head for the last three years and every so often the melody just comes through my head and that line that i wrote so i'm today i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna finish it
uh charged up but i'm gonna sit down and as an exercise i'm using my brain i'm gonna try to finish
there's definitely been more sweat than there has in the past yeah and an but i don't think it's because inspiration has disappeared i think it's more because i've become more specific about what it is i'm trying to
basically the same band brad out there on bass thomas bartlett on piano and keyboards rob moose on
but then of course the frames guys are also on there and then the horns that i that i've been working with on tour for the last couple of years those guys are on there they brought a lot to it
and then there's a few other musicians that i that i'd never met before who've come and gone uh which which are wonderful to
it's very important in a studio environment to challenge
to to work with people that you're maybe a little bit intimidated by because they might bring something to your song that you never thought
yeah because when you're out of your comfort zone some magic stuff can happen and
community of musicians that we know a whole community of great music that's made and i started from the street in a way it's
you're you're totally of breaking down the the barrier between the whole
think i learned every every basic rule of music and every basic rule
natural step to take to move from being on the street to dancing well we have this concert in this club after we play on the street we go to the club and we play and
we our our audience came from the street and followed us and then to make a record was a very natural progression from there so the whole thing it never really felt like there are these were all small goals in one year i would love to be in a band in two years i would love to make a
have to it's just so sometimes it's so overwhelming and something inside you takes
make uh the notes very strange it's very hard to explain how it happens but there's this huge energy that comes towards you and
except on a much on a much tinier level it's so much more subtle you know everything you do is so
two became a very popular band they signed their island records and and and then the other english major labels signed many irish
uh that was very good for us we had we had two really good years with them
other band who were assigned to our label called the cranberries uh did really really well and their record went crazy big it was
and and you know when something when it the the irony is when something is successful instead of it encouraging everybody else they just
uh to be to be our own label because it may it meant that we could um control everything we do
feel that we had to deliver a record to a certain uh
keeping a a smaller band who are really good down i hope that our success
that if i was in their position maybe i would you know step back for a while
i think it's really good it's really good to have success but you must always you must always
and and after i finished with the record uh and made it i went to jamaica and i spent some time there and i
basically through music to take a holiday and turn off your phone and go and go and be still is actually quite difficult and i found that when i was out there i i just i found that the music was just all i all i cared about was to listen to like you know i was just
you know to to to like can booth or or the paragons and just got really into rock steady and wanted to visit you know the studios in kingston and i'm and and suddenly i got really excited about music again the moment i took a holiday and then the
uh i'd opened a book on shamanism a few years ago called rythym and repose and i remember it really striking me as a
so so for instance uh so the moment you go and way up way
in in modern in modern day in modern times i like i'll even pull out my phone or whatever or text my mates but it where as actually i remember being a child those were the moments when i imagined my life they were the moments when i invented who i actually am they were the moments when my mind drifted off into space and nowadays you see a kid at a bus stop and he's on facebook and he's and he's actually kinda wasting those precious moments where you just let the brain
you know uh i just and what's great about jamaica though is that everybody hands you weed so the
and you you surrender to the to the moment you're in then no matter what goes right or wrong
you know so you have to surrender to the the to the chaos of what
it feels a it feels a lot easier now and in fact you know and again having time off because it what what it
evening hanging out with him and it was actually him who said don't worry about this feeling weird because you know he explained to me that for twenty years you've been a guy up and coming and you've been a guy up against the world and you know and and now that guy has just died and you're you're grieving his death and you're trying and at the same time you're trying on a new and having to work harder than ever so you're not getting an opportunity to uh to actually get used
mark your successes with either a holiday a dinner with your family a bottle of champagne if you don't mark your successes the day your ship comes in is gonna be just another day at the office
to markham and and and and so for me going to like when i finished the record going to the
can sort of what's the word play with the myth and play with and sort of come try to come up with a better version of what your life is but your life's what your life is and that's uh i i was
find ourselves in a room singing songs together again the likelihood of that right now is kinda small because mar is off you know living her life and i'm off living mine and if if we get together and and it feels good then great but uh i think you know
you don't ever wanna pick up your guitar and you know you only ever pick up the guitar to heal yourself you don't pick it up for any other reason but at the same time there's a great joy in playing music and that's where i'm finding myself nowadays is is i just love picking it up and playing you know i you know i watch
at the the new orleans jazz festival and i just was absolutely and utterly totally moved by just how much joy is in our music or levon
and uh like dylan came up playing other dylan's first album's full of covers uh
it it it it like the the people who are the people who are born out of that thing of playing other people's music eventually find themselves in that spot where they're like where it when it's all about you it's a heavy burden when it's all about just music then it gets a lot easier that's why in my gigs i'll like like i'll play two or three covers because i need relief from my from my own bullshit you know i i need to i
it was a few thousand people in front of me and it was one o'clock in the afternoon and i had an hour to fill with just me and a guitar and i was actually genuinely i
the stage i thought early it was like i was like oh please don't do this this is gonna ruin the
the music doesn't qualify because we wrote the songs for a film so i feel really clean about the idea that we can applaud them i remember on opening
really intense and and and and and and you're kinda hoping you're just you're praying that they're not gonna miss their mark you're sorta it's like watching a gig you're just hoping that they're gonna get there you know but i remember on opening night
did we don't i have i don't this is not ours anymore we have nothing to do with this anymore this is yours and so what's great about the tony nominations is that it's all for them and i feel really clean about the fact that we can go and applaud them and and be grateful for what the work they've done
her incredible sense of timing her sense of joy her i mean she just
six year old daughter and all of a sudden from being you know every night this amazing larger than life woman i i went back to making you know sandwiches
going back to a character as rich as norma desmond uh and to have twenty two years of life and twenty two years of learning my craft more you know more of that um and i
in london said let's just start from the beginning and i feel like a totally different person than i did
it's very challenging particularly in this role i think anyone who's ever attempted to play it will tell you it's physically challenging and it's
yeah i've i've come home and it will be a different take and hopefully people will
all the a lot of the top writers are now going into that arena also in in
i'd i mean i do because i do i do anything that uh that the script even
eel you know i i yep i mean on the last couple of years i think i've done about five or six independent
and i liked the character but as far as big you know you get a good hefty paycheck
challenging so i i think the story of norma desmond is as relevant
the world according to garp i think i think i was i'd just done one movie
no i i think when i started i've i've produced for television
you know i i have a production company there was a time when i was really doing that quite actively and you know this then came up as a story that i
you know trying to get him back to it you know working again getting a window of
you know its uh for example when i did the scout ten years ago it was with patrizia von brandenstein who is one of what the great one of the great
and she was on board with us ten years ago and when it came again when we
gathering our our team for for you know when we knew we were gonna make it she was the first call and she's never forgotten like me she had never forgotten the story she loved the story for her own personal
amazing team to do that my the man who made the wigs uh both
that he was he was you know really really important
uh happy sad you know tragicomic but the first great clown that i was aware of when i was little was
circus and we'd go every year and he was a set he was like a i think he that character came out of the depression
that show a very sad face but would just have the audience howling so i loved as a child the you know seeing somebody sad making you laugh you know so i think there were elements of that in albert so i studied charlie chaplin because um
i was interested in what made him funny in the way he
his pants are much too long his shoes are are clown shoes really so i
guys would have had pants too long and shoes too big so my pants are
lead to her comportment one is she is bound by the corset but also she's a waiter and there was a kind of a
i think there they definitely were aware that this character was a
certainly was he'd say there here's albert you know and but i also
um i yeah i think it was more shocking to them when i came not being albert because they were reminded
long hours and with a short schedule i was mostly in albert you know mode
kind of feeling thing because it's about working people it's about the back halls of of a hotel it's people who are in motion all day long so we wanted to have a camera that wasn't static that kind of
close up to catch what actors were doing um i think they're directors who
who don't really know sometimes where to put the camera to capture what a what an actor's
so that was very important you know and um richard and i were very much on very much on the same page
think this is a perfect time for this movie to come out and that's what's so ironic that it took so long to
means that you actually forget what you're looking at and gender becomes irrelevant and i when i that makes me think cause i think
is you know you might go into this film thinking you're gonna see something and you'll come out really
had huge uh respect for her she's a great stage actress and i literally walked into her dressing room and she was doing mary stewart and said would you do this part um
he was one of my sons um mark williams who plays the wonderful drunken uh waiter he was one of my
well first of all i believe i believe profoundly in their talent you know and i know what they'll bring to it and then you
uh you know what everyone longs for you know the best of the best uh but even our our set designer our our production designer patrizia von brandenstein had worked
is one of the greats and there she was in our little movie trying to figure out how to make it for five cents and what she did was
had no rights and were literally thrown out on the street so um i don't know if she would've chosen that uh for her you know but for at that moment when she
disappeared that was that was a logical choice the other character you know has an is a whole different
it's in good health i mean for instance to speak for my country it is a majority movement
now all of the fundamental issues of equality including reproductive issues are majority issues and that's true in many if not most countries and we know
uh how we feel about women as a group it's not about sitting around and criticizing who is a proper
funeral or anything because she cut off the milk for children i mean you know the point is not to get a job for one woman it's to make
well of course it's a feminist issue regardless of who it is if they were martians it would be a feminist issue you know because it's a
that is especially hard for many men who feel regressed to childhood when they see a powerful woman they haven't seen one since they were eight
there's a lot of deep feeling that it's just not right somehow that it's against
uh you know women are too emotional because you know we associate it with childhood it's
on campus when she ran for president before there were young white men wearing t shirts that said too bad oj didn't marry
if you wanna define yourself and i wanna define myself we have to let other people
because she had african american siblings i think and had been living as an african american and
so i can understand there's discomfort but the rock bottom thing is that we have to accept
speaking for myself as an average person at the time i
equality of males and females i would add acting on it
now we're in a a more difficult phase a slower phase of trying to actually
the way that families uh actually do and don't raise
quantity is not quality you know just because we have now almost fifty percent
that it's equal and the other problem is that of course we have two jobs for the most part i mean poor women always had two jobs one at home and one outside the home and now most
a culture that didn't want to change and therefore said first said you can't be
and then when we did it anyway said okay providing you do it
because society didn't wanna change so it was it was a recalcitrant
it's not about integrating a not so good system it's about transforming
and i think women are saying that so you it's actually probably more useful to think of women
groups we probably have a hard time making it up through
both because it's hard to get up through somebody else's hierarchy and because they don't
no i mean it's patriarchal politics as usual because the very definition of patriarchy is is
so every patriarchy in different ways tries to control how many workers how many soldiers uh which races or classes should increase more
freedom as a fundamental right we are seizing control of the means of
this is the biggest determinate of whether we're healthy how long we're gonna live are we educated can we work
every single issue raised by the feminist movement is now uh supported by a majority of americans and public
the not so genteel part of the backlash is all the anti laws you describe but both of them are aimed at at
if you grow up in a home in which it's okay
you can directly predict the amount of violence in public life or foreign
a catholic and a protestant woman saying we've had violence in the home too long we know that that's
nothing absolutely nothing that isn't affected by the female half of the human race as well
one way is to say we've realized that women can do what men can do and that's a big step forward because that was certainly not the fifties but we haven't even begun to realize that men can do what
that that was really helpful cause i think we get a kind of brainwashing in school
uh it's it's hard to express my dad simply you know because he was a playmate and he was
very nice patient person who looked after me at least as much more than my mother really cause my
possible in a wonderful way you know we always had dreams and everything was gonna be great and
i saw it but i thought that i could get around the system or something i
know i would pretend that wasn't gonna happen to me but but it was always there and also i saw
not because my father was not a nice person but because that's the way the world ran she she had to give up everything she loved and cared about she was a newspaper reporter
admit that it could also happen to me so now when i hear young women saying i hope i can have as interesting a life as
but uh you know people and she said people ask me why i'm not married i say i just say i can't mate in captivity and i knew if i said it i would get in big trouble but ultimately i couldn't resist no but it was because the picture of marriage that was
you know not for two whole people so i kept saying i'm gonna get
a question for eligible men one and two did you vote in
villain wait a minute this is for one and three one and three okay which one of batman's villains best describes your lovemaking
oh one at least has some idealism i figure even though the guy
um because i got to the last program and how ironic you know it was in france and that's where it
it was up in humberside um bonaparte's restaurant and i went to meet
and they served me a frozen scallop that i think the cat had pissed on the night before and i had
uh to london and i said to uh our exec producer pat lowello i said
serious because i i need to get back to my kitchen because you've got no idea how bad this is for me to be away from such amazing food in my own restaurant to go and eat shit that's cooked by
and secondly he served me food where the cat has literally pissed on it because i've never met or eaten a scallop so stinking in all my life
but i'm excited because i think these last
is four of the best programs we've ever made because the team were great uh
i'm prepared with no ulcers i don't want to walk around with rolaids in my pocket and dijex uh in my
back away for the last seventeen minutes uh so no i want to get back
say it's going away and it's finishing forever it may
i had a massive upset in football when i was nineteen and i got kicked out on my ass and
uh even today now we're the longest serving british restaurant uh with three michelin stars uh in this country uh
because there's two ways in this industry you you move with it or it moves you and i've seen so many sad stories across the
got lazy given up and lost that hunger to be competitive because it's the best job in the world that's not really a job it's a passion because when you're rubbing shoulders and here we are now ten years later and i
so that's exciting for me and that's been the one key issue across the ten years of filming kitchen
well i missed it so much when i came back i came back twice as strong so you know i think it's good to stop i wanna get out on top but more importantly i wanna come back
but i am a bloody good teacher and i think it's important to understand the discipline of perfection
yeah cause it's a very emotional thing for any chef you know it's like losing a girlfriend um you you want her back um i think every top chef in the world from alain ducasse uh to guy savoy you know when you lose a star it's
losing the champions league there's next year so it's not done forever that you can't win
question literally two weeks ago um on holiday what would you do if you ever lost your third star honestly i would win it back so you know it's it's it's it's nice to stay
work for the most amazing chefs when you are twenty one years of age working in one of the best restaurants in the world standing in paris
keen to learn and you've got a great chef's reputation in your hands if you make a mistake
level of perfection uh they give you that trust you let them down man you
uh i keep my mouth shut uh i was twenty one twenty two years of age the good news for me was
how's my real life is a really good question that um would be my mother's uh bread and butter pudding because we didn't grow up with lots of money uh freddy we we we it was a humble insight uh we moved around a
uh dad was always losing his job and every time he got a new job it came with a house when he lost his job he um we moved the family around so bread and butter pudding but beautifully done done with stale bread um custard sultanas and then sometimes as a treat
yes she worked as a nurse in the evening and she worked as a cook in a restaurant in stratford upon avon during the day so the food that didn't sell in the restaurant she could bring home
they sometimes when my mum comes to the restaurant a you can't give her the bill cause you can't do that to your mum right
i'd come out in a rash and my my my skin starts getting irritated
i mean it's the level of you know starch that we need in terms of daily balance so um it really makes chefs work a little bit harder to create vegetarian food to become just as exciting as your your your normal food on the menu but uh yeah
hey mom and dad there's this big englishman with a nice polite accent and uh so they haven't seen me on television yet god help
use the children to reeducate the parents i think in three or four years time we can start to understand that even if you never follow it as a career just learning to cook
um for me that's that's fundamental so that's the reason why we're we're filming
sixty four pounds and i was thirty three years of age and i had achieved what i wanted to set out and do in the culinary industry i i'd won my third
uh marathons ultra marathons in south africa i do comrades
bake and then a little marathon forty two k marathon at the end do you know what happened after i got home honestly he helped all the other people over the
on that's let me celebrate my forty ninth in peace so harry considers that to
tilly's gonna be fifteen so about five years ago she said dad look forget all your birthdays now because you know you've you've had
she would do a little skit on there and sort of do something exciting with a master chef sort of mystery
and some schmuck said do you know what the best thing about being fifty is the gateway to
and i was sprinting my uh i guess my son in the back garden turned round and bang achilles went so for the first time ever in like ten weeks you know i had to literally sit down
and it's quite sad cause i had like a sort of you know a backpack sort of rucksack on my back and had my sort of breakfast in there
don't us chaps have a bit of a bond so we all sort of look after each other um
no where near it honestly i i came from dubai i was on a flight sixteen and a half hours i was telling the uh hostess look please no food
about fifteen years ago i was being interviewed by a journalist and we'd just started hell's kitchen and uh the server said and take the salad to go i said what my caesar salad yeah for tomorrow morning i said do you have any idea how a salad
my driver it's the first time he's ever eaten it he lives on the street but he could never afford the time off to
land and you the flies are right with you within ten minutes i was so full
the fact is they turn twenty four hours a day so they sort of brine smoke rub and cook these things for such a long time
and there's no set hours there so once they've sold out that's it they shut up shop um they've never done a second outside austin which is amazing uh why don't we get barbecues right in the uk it's always pissing
will come to your door with bags open now you have a choice you can give them something good to eat
and they were collected into a tiny book and mgm somebody in was inspired to buy this tiny book and to show this very normal
the day needs the picture you know today and circumstances needs this picture very much and uh i sort of hesitated about it i said why are
wouldn't you like to play mrs miniver and uh it was not an offer it was an oblique sort of thing whereupon norma said well grace is playing that
out of the window again nothing nothing more was said but of course when the pictures came out and poor norma her little comedy which was light and funny uh was not a very well
that she had been offered the part and turned it down but she wasn't really offered the part i was to play the part and that was it and walter you
we made seven pictures together seven and a half we won't talk about the half it was a clinker but we
certain pictures together we never had an insecure thought about each other or um an angry cross word or a tiff or anything like that it was the most wonderful partnership wonderful
when his wife called me ruth called me last summer and told me the bad news i was in
uh everybody the the cameraman was a well one of the great artists of hollywood of course joseph ruttenberg uh the the
peoples everywhere and we all tried to make it as special as we could as
easy to me and then of course came experiences that none of us over here recall
but my family and my friends were all involved i had tried to
back to england to serve in some way in the war i was embarrassed being
actually falling the place where i lived had lived and the city that i loved and the people i
executives at mgm were trying to release me from my contract i flew to see the british ambassador and he was very charming he said uh
drive a truck there's red cross work there's canteen work first aid work air warden work all those things patrols all those things and he said well frankly i said a soup kitchen
he did the queen the queen mother our beloved queen mum she said to me later
very interesting i kind of disappeared for a while into the charming personality of mrs miniver and you know and we for a while perhaps as an actress i was a little restless
a great reason to be thankful and grateful so many actors do better and better work through
i stop in new york or los angeles or dallas for an intersection traffic light you know waiting for the go sign to cross and nearly always somebody would
random harvest uh he was so wonderful in that part and i was so happy when
it's a royal command performance so naturally stars come over and then we have the honor of being presented
wouldn't remember but anyhow uh king george was so kind to me he said
um there were groups especially of course at war time uh we were all working for the british red cross and putting on benefits and that sort of thing but we always
to just whatever we did for british red cross naturally we also would do the same thing for american red cross so we were together a good deal in in benefit performances and things we put on a season of in hollywood went very well we all changed hats the series actors played comedy the comic actors played
i sang as i drove to studio in the mornings i looked forward so much to another day in this wonderful group and wonderful life story wonderful love story
quiet scenes turbulent scenes intimate scenes crowd scenes and uh we collected a great group of actors as i told you merlin leroy was a dear he always had some of the old timers coming out of the woodwork and playing small parts and they were so grateful to him for that and it was a joy to
believable well you can make them believable but to make them interesting is quite a challenge quite a it's much more
but it was my lot to to play good ladies and dove dove women and on the stage i had played some peacock
well i was quite certain that i would eventually be in a play that was good enough to go to broadway that's really the way i would like to have gone to america everybody was curious about america we all wanted to go to america not necessarily to live there in fact it was never my intent
for a few days and then we found we had so much in common he'd started at northampton repertory i'd started at birmingham repertory and we used to have little jokes if he made a mistake i'd say ha
the director said cut cut it was mervin roy cut what is it this time what's the matter and a voice from way back you know fifty feet fifty uh yards
i was making tea see i wasn't making tea but somebody was making tea for me and there you are anyhow as i say we served um uh a cup of tea cup of gin
gin because he insisted on having gin in the afternoon and i didn't i said i don't want any pantry drinking on this set you come and have your tea in your own tea cup
oh yeah we've played so many practical jokes on each other it's amazing the picture ever got
from the film institute in los angeles and we stood up together on the platform and i said here we stand survivors of the wyler's wars and so two of the milestones the human milestones along the brilliant road of a superb
and what would you like us to say and so on and we we had a few jokes you know because he was kind of fifty take
into some kind of a mental or aesthetic gem and he wouldn't tell anybody why
i can remember a scene when we were early scene when we were filing into the church
the day that war was declared and the vicar interrupted his sermon to make this
but we're all filing in we're of course everybody in those days was aware of the danger but i think nobody ever quite believed it
uh was holding i was holding him by the hand as we walked in i think i was turning and talking to some nice lady as we went in uh just rhubarb and sausages rhubarb and sausages not real dialect dialog i mean just some noises crowd noises moving into the church and the little boy reached out and picked up the heavy lion and ring door handle on the
he came back we did about twenty eight eight more anyhow it was something like the fifty
what is it that i can tell you now i do want to tell you cause the boy little boy would've done it in a self conscious way and i wanted i wanted the business to be just as it was before quite spontaneous so we
in it reported in the english press and the american press as a two hours and a
the evidence anyhow it was quite a modest speech i was too long because at twelve o'clock at night
informal meeting we had dinner and nothing was regulated for tv timing or anything like that
up since four forty five that morning i'd been working in madame curie which is a heavy picture to do and i was so tired i had a blinding
i took the opportunity which i should not have taken of course to say that i thought the
one of the best opportunities of the year and in the opinion of your peers uh you have risen to the opportunity and done a professional job that's enough but to choose one arbitrarily and and and give them a lovely uh statue
and uh we all support each other it's a wonderful and generous
there's a distracting change of light you have to do it again or if the noise is off if a donkey brays not
uh i have been surprised to hear young critics who are not old enough really to know what they're talking about uh
the maid uh delightful actress who behaved very
simply delightful and it was all very real in the shopping and the uh pleasant stationmaster i don't know what they're talking
and the appurtenances the home was rather pleasant after all clemenceau was an architect and i imagine he did a rather nice job on his own house and the house was not overly grandish at all
and and uh you know mgm were were really very generous they could have held it back when they smelt the sweet sweet smell of success uh from the early previews
president roosevelt asked them to get it out in general release so that as many people could see it as soon as possible i like to think that
in america i don't blame people for not wanting to get into a war
it was a global war and it would have affected america disastrously anyhow if the freedom loving
um he at first i thought he was he's an atrian and he's roman's best friend and he has no love for the human
and at first i thought he was just gonna be just some angry atrian hating on the humans and then later episodes you find out the reasons behind it that kinda validates
i mean besides the obvious is how beautiful natalie is and taylor is
she's she doesn't she's kind of a fireball herself she doesn't really
she doesn't seem afraid of me like everybody else i think of drake so i think that's what he's drawn to she's kind of like the alpha
he he's sees a different side of of the humans through her it's it's fun i love our stuff together
yeah she's funny but then she can turn on the serious too i mean she's real
i don't have any like special powers as far as like what what teri's tribe has
i mean he just is very hard headed and he's very sure about himself in not an arrogant way he just knows who he is and
he's of the warrior tribe and the trags who are like a
evil atrium crew they recruit him and at
i mean like i said drake and roman are best friends um i always compare drake to kind of like the mercutio to to
roman's in love with emery you know he doesn't get it all's he has ever known is pain with the humans and um teri he's he's good friends with teri although now their relationship is being tested cause teri's doing some shady things and then uh
sister he he has a lot of love for her more of a sister relationship cause roman and drake are so tight
the other three they haven't really established who they are yet they're great you know but they haven't really established like what tribe these guys are from they're more like they've kinda been more background but i think as a show
and i'm not just saying this and i feel like i always say it but these writers meredith and adele what they've created this world i mean there's so many intricate things going
now i know everyone you know says that about their show but i really mean it like i'm excited for them to to see this adventure
stuff's amazing i didn't think it was gonna be so huge uh i i mean i was walking through and i went to the pub across the
and uh i am one of seven aliens um but the our whole race is uh imprisoned in this sector and then ten years later they uh choose seven of us to uh get integrated into the earth school system so it's like the trials and tribulations of that and
so that and there's a love story boy uh you know alien boy meets human girl there's the romeo and juliet so it's a really
i i loved it i and i loved my character i i originally i didn't think the character was gonna be so prominent in the show and they kinda um you know they liked the character and they expanded on him and i just i loved every second of shooting it
yeah we have uh matt lanter from nine oh two one oh and aimee teegarden from friday night lights they're both great they're the two leads um my love interest natalie hall she was the best actress i've ever worked with she's like eh went to an acting high school
classically trained and for someone like me that kind of just goes off of instinct it was really nice just to work with someone like that and we helped each other out and it was it was an amazing
emotions and all these things going on that like no matter what i did i think they were just like yeah yeah drake drake's feeling
as as a as an actor it was fun to play an alien because there's so many things that you can kind of make up on your own because nobody really knows like we had our whole language and the joke on set was like if you get the
i think the world you know i can speak for for my show the the world that meredith and adele the creators created were was just so intricate and i think that's what people dig about sci fi and fantasy is that there's this whole fantasy world that's created that you can kinda just pick from and and your imagination just runs wild it's
um i wrote a film called danny boy that i'm starring in and producing and we should be starting that in the fall
yeah so that's a irish crime drama uh this kid danny he grows up in this irish crime family he's a
and he um his family basically his mom and his brother die on the way to one of his boxing matches
you know swept up into this irish crime and there's a love story in there and then his uncle gets into a huge gambling debt and he's gotta fight in this underground uh fight ring to get his uncle out of
it's fair you know the best man wins there's no cheating it's just a mano e mano and people in it you really have to
and see what that was like i was really looking forward to see what that was gonna look like and what the set was gonna look like for that so that would have been fun
um the last episode was pretty amazing uh and we were rushing so hard to get it done cause there was all these like action scenes and stuff like that and we we all had to like come together and
and get down and just really really work hard and not mess up and a lot of long days and i think the final episode came out amazing that final scene was pretty
go that way i mean i i did a show for five years so
dancing with the stars and we aired during the olympics so i mean we kinda had we were throwing them to the
flattering and nice cause they want to kind of follow my career which means a lot to me
not yet i'm always like i'm always uh i always think it's cool when guys come up to me cause it's always mostly like the teenage girls because of my other show and i always think it's really cool like this uh i did wondercon
he's like that's drake and it was like cool cause he was looking at me like i was like like i used to look at like a
leo was a big one for me uh basketball diaries was one of the movies that made me want to be an actor
wahlberg mark wahlberg we come from the same area so that's kind of a he's kind of a role model for me um jack nicholson was always my dad's favorite i was brought up on
you know i did a law and order just a couple months ago and mariska hargitay uh forgive if i'm butchering her name but
she's been on that show for fifteen years it's basically her show and she's still so passionate about each scene and each episode she really wants to get it right and that was like very humbling as an actor and and very inspirational
the role i wrote for myself is kinda my dream role so hopefully i'll be doing
thank you guys so much for following my career and and and showing up today it means a lot and uh
yeah it's basically a alien ship crashes on earth and ah i am one of seven aliens um but the our whole race is uh imprisoned in this sector and then ten years later they uh choose seven of us to get integrated into the earth school system so it's like the trials and tribulations of that and there's a love story boy uh you know alien boy meets human girl

oceans and all these things going on that like no matter what i did i think they were just like yeah yeah drake's drake's

you know i can speak for for my show the the world that meredith and adele the creators created were was just so intricate and i think that's what people dig about sci fi and fantasy is that there's this whole fantasy world that's created that you can kind of just pick from and and your imagination just runs wild

never big on sci fi but i mean i would you know doing star crossed for a season i kinda really got into it that'd be you know but the role i wrote for myself is kinda my dream role so hopefully i'll be doing
us thank you guys so much for following my career and and and showing up today it means a lot and uh i hope to have more work for you
into one was if you have money i think it's important to act in a proper way and act in a classy way um and not be entitled and not just kind of go through your years being wild and and
and if you're on the other end of the spectrum spectrum financially i think it's important to see somebody
everybody has a tough life everybody has their own problems and their own secrets but sometimes the rich even have more you know and it's uh
definition of affluenza is you know a disease where people consumed by earning as much money as possible which i think
appreciate the kind of simple things in life not that i'm like some
you know god that's trying to like bring some light on the world but i think it's important to be
uh i've always been quite a strong character in my eyes you know when you're fifteen and
or take drug it doesn't really interest me um but pressures of course you know you know if you have a meeting at eight o'clock in the morning and all your friends are going out till one o'clock in the morning obviously as a young kid you wanna experience life you wanna hang out with your friends but sometimes you make sacrifices and i think in order to get to the top
dee you have to make sacrifices otherwise your life becomes one big party and then you know you don't actually appreciate the parties cause you're out all the time so so yeah pressures you know of course at seventeen years old i moved to the states by myself it's not
um nicola's been doing fantastic grant's doing fantastic he's
is now um a fantastic and very well respected tv show and i remember looking around and
drop you know but i did look around and think these guys are so talented and and this movie could be the next crop and the next
including myself keep um working hard and and and doing amazing things in regards to like career work but
move them um have the capability of going extremely far and and for stay
um i think we're the most selfish i think we're the most
um loyalty doesn't matter i think it's just a very i think honestly we live in a very sad society and i think if it continues to go this way uh there's gonna be a lot of funerals uh
a lot of empty funerals which is very sad and i don't wanna be like a downer but i do think that technology as amazing as it is
is absolutely horrendous for our society and our well being you know if you go on a subway for example people think it's quite weird that i talk to
like i'm only asking how your day is and they think i'm like trying to find out everything about their life so um so yeah i think that's something that if if we could change it would be amazing but
me that in order to stay at the school i had to quit acting um and i told him that i completely disagree with what he had to say because i think the whole point of school is to kind of let
um really appreciate what's going on around you really appreciate your friends really
um life you know in my opinion have a half glass full mentality i think that that's the best thing because life isn't perfect
there will be more um and through hard times when the chips are down
very important to be strong you know whether it's on the smaller scale if you're having troubles at
i think now that we're doing this whole like you know this right now uh of course brings back memories but it's it was a good time to end the show the show when had four fabulous
and i made some amazing friends out of it i made some great relationships out of
and i'm just very very happy that it ended when it ended and also it ended the way
and and also just the crew you know a lot of crews never get mentioned but the crew is i think the reason why the the show did so well um of course no one sees it on tv they just see the cast but
crew uh probably the best crew i've ever worked with the nicest crew i've ever worked with the most friendly crew i've ever worked with and yeah it was they were like my family you know i had like father figures mother figures loads of step moms um cause my you know my family
so it's nice to kind of have that stability you know when i it was weird when i went to work i felt like i was driving
like with him and the wand is already proven it doesn't work so him had even more powers than
i think you know they all blend the problem you know the problem is when you do a tv show is they all blend into into into one and you can't remember where the weeks go you can't remember where the episodes go but the first one you always remember and i remember that very well
um and then we had a after that episode we have had a one hour special which
dance special effects and then there was an episode called um harperella which came out maybe two months ago which was pretty
and then of course the last one it's pretty sad though when you remember four episodes out of
um so for me it's become very very very natural uh
i love him as an actor and i love our dynamic on the show uh and that's gonna be gonna be a a big
based on two girls who are mistakenly identified as lesbians in high school and it kind of catapults them to popularity and it's uh one of them happens to be a lesbian and and
yeah exactly and so it's kind of one of those shows which has been amazing for me to be on because it's set such a positive message to people watching uh
school itself is a character of the show in in hestor high you kind of have to stand out to fit in um whereas most schools they kinda
yeah no it's it's i don't know how i would react to be honest i went to an all
it prom was such an awkward we don't have prom but like school dances i was so awkward and so shy
channel and i played selena gomez's uh love interest but also a werewolf so that was
in england and then judy taylor and gary marshall work at uh disney channel kind of brought
and obviously working and and kind of furthering my career and my manager was like look you have to learn the american
owens since she was like twelve um and we're family friends and we kind of
it makes me sound so intelligent and i'm really not like i i dropped out of
sometime after the movie greenberg came out which i acted in which he directed and wrote uh if i would be interested in collaborating on a project with him
so much at that time i had not finished anything as a writer so i actually had all this
assembled a lot of it together and i sent it all to him and i said
it started from very little we we really discovered it together
end of it i can't tell you where the eggs are they're just kind of in there and so there's there's parts of my life and noah's life in the movie and people we know and things we've made up and once it's all in there though it really feels like it all belongs to the movie and the
a lead story is something you do you eh that happens again and again and again throughout your whole life and
you're charged with the task of shedding an older version of what you thought you should be or what you you wanna be and deal with what you actually are or what's actually in front of you and i think that happens at twelve i think it happens at thirty i think it happens at fifty eight i think it happens all the time and i think
against the forces that work in her life and instead of responding as a rational adult she becomes almost
well i've i love dancers um i know a lot of dancers i've never
so heartbreaking because even if you do succeed the rewards are so small
a a dancer as opposed to a painter or a writer or a actress or a um
a a dancer really does have a time limit in the way that athletes have time limits
it probably won't happen and i think one thing in the film that we explore is that there's not a time that being a choreographer has a much longer life but that being a dancer in that way
there's a deadline there's a terminus and i think that one of the scenes in the film is that that is approaching at the same time as her friendship with sophie is unable to sustain itself so it was two things that worked in youth but not in
um he does that with his actors you only read the part that you're in and so
in francis we took that idea and we only gave people the parts they were
role and then they would be sad to give up acting but if there are no good roles then i would rather
do you know i think i don't no one ever said that to me but i do think twenty seven was the first time i ever heard anyone was it up until twenty
and you've got so much time and then all of a sudden you're twenty seven and everyone's like well
you should probably figure this out and it's it was like it happened overnight and i felt i felt like it was just the i was sort of just echoing this idea of um it's the first time in your life when you're not
in some ways it's that that line is people bring it up all the time
i think i think i i think i wrote that line it was almost a throwaway it was just like a joke she says and then sometimes you know you're writing a line that feels quotable
uh i don't i don't know it was uh i don't know where that line came from
we really take our time with this script because we we don't um we don't have any we don't let anybody improvise or even change a a word we like it really said the way it's written um because it's very
and um yeah it it just i mean writing a script takes takes time um so it's a lot of talking a lot of looking at other movies we're inspired by a lot of of writing material we tend to write material separately and then we um at some point we have tons of material
when we're when we're together but um it's kind of like it's hard to say exactly when things start but it's we do we kind of build the story and the characters at the same time and there's just a point when
and then you think oh this actually isn't so bad and then and then eventually you have something that you're like oh yeah if we shot this we'd be
uh at a certain point we'll like know an ending and um and
and then and there's a certain point when you sort of jump ahead and then jump back and then um yeah but an ending will
i think learning how to take criticism is is a skill i don't think it's something you innately know how to do but i think i really learned by um watching noah and i'm friends with a lot of other writers the best writers i'm
seek out people's opinions constantly they don't go away in their room and try to make it perfect
own they show drafts to people they rework things all the time and i think there's this uh
there's this myth of an artist that goes away and makes a perfect thing and then comes out and shows everybody i don't think that's true of the people i know who are writers they're like they're always seeking and
to yourself instead of um let it happen to you to like go to people and say what do you think i should change what do you think is not not working what joke
always that thing if someone writes a joke that you know you've
something else but she didn't know that it was my my joke it's just like you feel like you gotta get your material out there cause you know we're all trying to make jokes about
and sacramento is like a a town where you you don't get a lot of like
oh my god i've been looking at the wrong thing i've been looking i mean not that looking at actors is the wrong thing
watched it if i liked something then i just watched everything the director had done
angelica and lincoln center and walter reed and which
a shakespeare play and i had one word and i
i was i had been i i was dating at the time someone who had made it
with joe swanberg but i i hadn't really met joe or i had met well i him once briefly but i
he said it's not hardcore it's mumblecore because it was so hard the the sound quality was so bad
for a while it was like things made cheaply things improvised
in films as they saw presenting lives that they were like but that's not how we live our lives this is how we live our lives like that's not how we have sex or talk to each
and it and it allowed them to watch these kinds of films whereas before they
i i took a lot of i want to say guts but i think it was really more
go for it which i i mean i i can say that because i feel like i'm i'm twenty
and at the i lived i lived in an i mean i shared um i
it very like yeah it was very traditional i was i was auditioning a lot i had a
in love with this part and i just but i didn't think that there was any chance that i
and how human these people were but the it was
and i saw i mean i right away i felt like i saw it was less falling in love with florence and more
and i saw i mean i right away i felt like i saw it was less falling in love with florence and more it felt like falling in love with rogers through florence's eyes pretty
than you'd have if you were in los angelos like the fighting through traffic it's a
used books from college and i just like it was so nice to be able to contribute like that
it it would be the opening sequence i didn't know it would be the driving or that's what you mean uh i didn't know
i think the part of why it works so well is because um we do it for so long
sees that girl and you're supposed to laugh but i think there's always something cool about people that are you supposed to laugh are you acting uh what's happening right
uh it's been really fantastic especially to have both of these films you know belle being my first lead in a movie and and and then you know closely followed by beyond the
year for costumes i have to say you know in belle obviously um set
contrasting and you know the world of of the piece is very edgy and modern but as you say the themes of identity um you know the themes of a woman sort of struggling with who she is and then finally accepting herself and
common in both and i didn't see it at first um and now i i i appreciate
uh lord mansfield who is played by magnificently by tom wilkinson in the film he
little snippets that that were about dido um you know in some
uh a woman of color in a period drama who wasn't a slave who wasn't a maid who wasn't in a subservient role but had sort of a dignified um position in society
a wonderful director really brought out a lot of the contemporary resonances and and really we talked a lot about the universal
me i suppose you know i learned so much um from working with tom hanks who first directed me in america you know as a leading
he brought to the set with that movie you know which which is that you're not just a a leading actress but you are sort of leading
their persona you know the idea that um more so i think for music artists than actors thankfully but um you know that you have uh or or my character noni has this um very sexualized identity that has been crafted for her by her record label and her her
to you psychologically if you're never allowed to switch off and especially in the case of if if the persona out there about you is
the time to develop any sense of self esteem so um you know
just a little busier now and and um i'm just about to do another project so there so there's a lot sort of
i don't know if i would experience it myself um i think it's one of those things i do think that certainly in our episode for our characters it's a positive experience but um i don't know i think i'd have to see if i
yeah it's hard to talk about it without spoiling without spoiling the story but um i don't know
um i i have to i think i have to believe i believe in the romance of of our episode a hundred percent um you know again it's hard to talk about you know um how you would want your
amazing i have to say it was one of those scripts that i read and i i got it on an email on my phone and i started to read it on my phone and i ended up reading the whole script on my phone which is kind of quite black mirror
it you know where it was going which was great i think you know for audiences of black mirror
in a good way you know i i think it doesn't just play to your you know sedative kind of television it's it's much more refreshing and as i say it makes you think and and that i really loved i just thought it was completely original so um yeah it was a no
uh it really did feel like we were working on a film and you know the director owen harris is so great and um in terms of preparation i listened to a
so heavily in the episode and it's so evocative of that period and then you get into the costumes and the shoulder pads and the big hair and you know my character is quite an extrovert so it was fun to play around with that kind of stuff um and it was a really quick shoot it was only about fourteen days
rehearsal you know so we just sort of had to jump in there were a few sort of dance uh
which was fun and we did a table read but beyond that it was more like just
well i think you know like all black mirror episodes i think they're open to interpretation and i think that everybody will bring their own experience and and have their own debate what i love about it is it it does sort of provoke a conversation you know would you go through this experience if you had the option is this potentially possible um but i also think you know it brings up idea
manufacturer sold or you know all of those kind of things and um and for me those are quite big and deep questions um but at the same time i was having these big things to think about it's also really romantic really
and a really vibrant vibrant episode so i hope people will
me again it's i guess about the idea of you know having this coming of age story you know and how old is your soul and i think you know you can have somebody you know uh with a an old body and a young soul and a a young body and an old soul and and that's fascinating to me in general um so yeah it was it was a really
i mean i have to confess i hadn't watched black mirror before i got sent this script so i'd heard of it and um i was in london i was doing a play and my agent sent me the script i was like you know
episode and i was i just had my phone to read it on and sort of ironically enough and very black mirroresque i started to read it on my phone and it was so good i read the whole episode on my phone in about forty five minutes um and it was really a no brainer i mean the script was so beautifully written and charlie brooker is genius so um yeah a hundred percent i was i was
uh i know it's tricky i i totally agree the thing with black mirror is the concepts are so mind blowing that if you know too much it just spoils the experience but um i get to work with mackenzie davis who's a wonderful actress and uh part of the episode is set in the eighties uh and it's romantic um
i know i was saying earlier you know the the sort of main character jacket i had was an original eighties versace purple suede jacket with tassels and they embellished it with all these sorta sparkly bits uh but i don't know how i would make that work you know in my
i know it's bizarre i saw bryce dallas howard in la a few weeks ago and um
i'm goo goo we're both in black mirror you know totally fan girled on her and um and then we had to got the lovely experience to going to the toronto film festival at the same time but yeah i mean i've only seen nosedive i haven't seen any of the other episodes i've seen obviously but um i'm as excited as anyone
no we were just both cast in the roles so there was no sort of chance to really get to know each other and it was a very fast uh process we shot it in fourteen days um the seven days in london and seven days in cape town and there wasn't really much time for rehearsal i mean we had a a read through and uh you know we we hung out a little bit and got to catch up but um yeah it was just
jump straight into it but um i have to say you know credit to the writing because you know i think charlie's so great at writing dialogue i really felt like the characters were so clearly drawn on the page that you know my
he's so approachable i mean i love him to bits he's kind of the the sort of genius you sort of feel like you could be best mates with you know he's very you know down to earth but obviously by his
you know he was around a lot um but but you know not in an oppressive way he'd pop in um he couldn't come to south africa which i think he was a bit gutted about cause he was doing his screenwipe uh show so um he was around a bit
yeah it's really special and it's a real honor to be invited to film festivals as i say we were at toronto earlier in the year and i think especially for something that's going to be on netflix that maybe most people will see on an ipad or a laptop or in their pajamas you know to actually have it have a theatrical life like you say because you know the cinematography's so beautiful and the locations are really sweeping and um i think that's really
oh a hundred percent and tv is so good and the characters that you get to play you know uh especially on on netflix as well you know really strong female roles really um groundbreaking i think you know something like black mirror is so refreshing it it doesn't really fit into any sort of regular procedural type box and i think that that's really exciting for people who are doing film cause you don't have to commit
is in in one character for years on end you know you can go in and have a a filmic experience but its contained and its also exploring some quite
special effects were all done but i have to say you know i'm so excited about it and i'm completely bias because i was obsessed with the original animation when i was a kid and i knew all the words it was like my frozen really so um yeah and it's such a beautiful cast you know an amazing ensemble of british actors and american actors as well um yeah i'm really excited for everyone to see i can't wait to see it when it's finished but um yeah
i've created something that um is is so gloriously epically fantastical but has some of the most
looks wonderful and everything you know all the production values are so so high and and everyone on the show really cares about it and i think that
it was a huge privilege it was exactly the kind of role that i'd always wanted to play i mean that's the it's it's roles like that make you want to become an actor
i was aware uh that i had a a responsibility because so many people were a fan of the character from the book
kind of you but i think it's um you know brienne's a is is a is a is a classic outsider but uh
where that's unusual and um and she's been very much
and she's overcome that by becoming a knight um and i think that
feeling like an outsider is something that everyone can relate to and some people more than others and overcoming it gives gives hope to all of us it certainly gives hope to me you know it's a huge
it's a huge privilege and and inspirational to to be playing a a part where
different relationship and she's she's put in direct contact with someone
she's having to not only keep her vow to to captain stark and fulfill that as best she can but she's
um what i can tell you about captain phasma is that captain phasma is the captain of
she is a member of the first order and part of the dark
she is a boba fett style of character which means that she is not at the forefront of the action but
it was really extraordinary because i was in uh new york for the season three premiere of game of thrones and i got the phone call
you have a meeting for star wars and so i flew back home after the premiere immediately and went to the meeting and
it took a bit of time to work out because i had a very wonderful problem in that i was sort of filming game of thrones at the same time as star wars was filming so that took a little bit of working out
game of thrones at the same time as star wars was filming so that took a little bit of working out and both parties both star wars and game of thrones were incredibly generous and worked together to facilitate this amazing opportunity but that did happen over a series of weeks so i did at some points have to entertain the possibility that
i didn't want to get too upset if it didn't happen but when i knew it was happening
remember i was very young when i first saw it it seemed so magical because it was at christmas uh i was very young i was about six years old and
i was just enthralled by it it was so magical it it literally transported me to a different place it took me into a different universe and a universe i wanted to be a part of because it seems
different and there was such variety in people there were wookies and there were robots and and robots that you fell in love with and and women with really strong personalities that wouldn't take no for an answer and and sardonic cool men and and
even started but i do i am afflicted with this terrible
that a friend of mine rang me and said there's something about you being in an hbo show and who doesn't actors or not who doesn't wanna be in an hbo show and i'd really wanted to work
and so i thought okay what's this about and i googled uh the books and i read a brief synopsis and then i read about the character and
play this part and to explore this kind of person and and i never knew it would be as wonderfully successful as it has been but that's very heartening to me because what that says is we wanna see different kinds of people in our entertainment and i do think brienne of tarth has
to me because what that says is we wanna see different kinds of people in our entertainment and i do think
is a a boba fett style character so that means she is not at the forefront of the action but she certainly makes an
seen very much on screen so far um so i'm obviously very very excited about that um but what really excites me about the part is that from what we've seen so far uh captain phasma has a particularly badass
important at the neck from the neck up what went on there um but it was interesting to me is that in our in our culture we're really used to seeing female characters and we relate to them due to the way that they are made
when we're born but this character we're relating to due to her choices and her actions first and foremost and i think that's really progressive and modern particularly in a
do i think i was about six years old it was christmastime it was shown to me by my family and i completely fell in love with it i i fell in love the with that fact there was this
everything for me but obviously it's our foundation story of good against evil but there's something very magical about it and i
so much in a teenager's life almost everything in a teenager's life is
in such a reasonable way so blown out of proportion um every little thing that happens is such a huge event in your life at that
everything that happens to nadine means so much and i think that's what pushes the boundaries is that everything
that were so similar to nadine's and it felt very weird going in there and being like i went through this
went through this or something similar and it's just a weird sort of vulnerable state i felt i i was in because i went in there and i was like this is so similar to to to what i've experienced in life and to what
all she wears her feelings her heart her everything on her sleeve
and even when you know she's trying not to let whatever it is get to her you know how she's really feeling and there's something so
refreshing about seeing someone that just like feels like you know there's so much that she goes through with so many different people in this movie from her best friend to her
the ultimate best friend relationship it's the relationship where
if you're not in the same room you're most likely texting or on the phone or on facetime with that person talking about what you're doing or not saying anything at all
is the uh he's just he's the only person that just pretends to show any interest in my conversation um
he listens to her and he welcomes her uh to an extent um but is so unfazed by anything she has to say and that just keeps her like on her toes and keeps her thinking of any possible thing she can say for the shock value um and that's what i guess one of the things i love so much about nadine is just she just doesn't
hatred that nadine has for this person that she looks at and sees as absolutely
got everything from beyond the looks he's got the grades he's got the school loving him every person walks by he he walks by in the hallways turns to him and gives him a high five or gives him shows him attention and love and i walk down and people snicker and look at me up and down and we're
incredible because i'm able to just have a conversation with kelly and see in her eyes
passionate she is and see where everything comes from um and just in conversation it's been so helpful
oh no so i went in and i said you guys pull up that track pull it up i said to you stop go again that's why i stopped because i saw something so they pull up the track
right you can hear this insane like breath over the mic right before you hear me say oh my god wait go again it is the most i get the chills every time i hear it it's the it scares the
marilyn monroe's and frank sinatra's old apartments so am i being marilyn monroe breathing on
i guess with on the acting side just sort of facing rejection in a way i feel like you can kind of
for years of just reading for the same people that you think oh my god this could be the one and then it's like no it's not you were never right in the first place and i think like getting that's almost like getting booed like y
that there's just a the level of vulnerability that's like through the roof and i i i definitely have felt that similarly but i've never been
so for i did my i made my first movie when i was thirteen i started auditioning at nine
for all those years i would go in and i would audition and i didn't know any different i made a couple student films i guest starred in a couple sitcoms i didn't really know the lay of the land of making a full length movie or or really any
i obviously then went back and and started auditioning for other parts again and i had the hardest time for the longest time because i realized what a difference
a location other actors directors that know how to direct you and then you go into a room with white walls and five people staring at you and you're reading off a piece of paper and it's like why can't i do this so it
i obviously then went back and started auditioning for other parts again and i had the hardest time for the longest time because i realized what a difference hair and makeup makes
a location other actors directors that know how to direct you and then you go into a room with white walls and five people staring at you and you're reading off a piece of paper and it's like why can't i do this so it it definitely was a i mean it's not easy it's so not easy but
and it goes on like everything funny story the other day um i was in new york city and i have an obsession with cereal and so i had a box of cereal of a brand that like i normally eat but it just was a different it was like an off brand of the brand that i eat and uh
in between like i was doing like phone interviews and in between interviews i would just like eat a ton of it right and um like a couple hours later
like blew up and my face got really swollen then i was like what is happening to me this is like who am i um turns out there were nuts in the cereal and my face just like i have
themselves uh and i've always wanted to come here especially knowing that this is where they're from uh so to have it
to be here because of the music and to have the music playing here is just it
aside from doing what like i love uh i love
go down to the beach and just like sit outside for hours in the sun
and just by the water and just relax and kind of not do much um
do too but that's a that's an interesting question i would probably say either like a great bowl or or a
i um i haven't made the last movie i made was pitch perfect two and that was
but a minute um so that was the last movie i made and since then i have been focusing on music um my next movie uh is in october so i will continue to to make movies and make music so we'll see how we'll
okay so i'm gonna make it like i'm trying to get you to guess what i'm doing okay but i
uh well i would try my best to play it cool i don't know how well i would do but
i would just try and have like a normal conversation i guess right i don't know what do you do
and i just am looking forward to one thing i love so much about making music and recording music is that it almost it's almost a never ending process even though like you eventually make an ep
project you move on and you either never see it again or you have no idea what happens it's out of your hands um and with music it's like i started about six seven months ago and it's so completely different
continuing to make music and then see how it evolves and see how it changes but um eventually i'll put some out no this
um i think there are a lot of michael moore haters out there because they were trained at an early age to be michael moore haters and i'm not i i don't mean that facetiously i mean there is an element
the um the idea of being pro america to a certain group of people means never questioning it which is the most unhealthy view you can possibly have there was this american protectionism which is if you try to chip away at our facade
not the person who's totally full of shit and and when you're in a position where your industry what you do for a living in michael moore's case is you make the case that we're living behind a facade this is
two years ago when he was on cnn did a an expose on how crappy the american healthcare system is and now he's protecting it from the fascist obama it's absurd it's sales and he's trying to get past the veneer of sales whenever you do that the people who sell the stuff are gonna come after you and they're gonna come after you hard and they're gonna motivate people who are dumb and uneducated and love living that way to get to to
um i'm on a standup tour and then uh i have a new series but i can't talk about it yet which is very exciting um and then i'm recording a standup album this week in
atlanta uh at the laughing skull lounge so um it's good you know it's tough being so multi talented and my band's second album will be coming out uh late january or early february uh the band zero one and the album's called uh the
to make fun of myself um i quite frankly i don't think uh celebrities are good points for lampooning unless their behavior uh
make their living trying to be famous making fun of people who are already famous it's for for being famous it's the biggest it's like pop eating itself so uh
sorry to beat around the bush but yeah yeah exactly what's his name harvey what's his name yeah
yeah harvey levin's not a lawyer he's a he's a peeping tom who found who
a living uh of being a peeping tom he's just a there's no law to what he does he stands in an office with a bunch of other idiots well i just got off the phone
and you know uh we think her shoes don't match her belt like that's you know
what the hell what a waste of time i can't imagine being harvey levin and laying your pillow your head on your pillow every night and going man i i did nothing to better the world in any way i made no one better today i didn't even make them laugh i made them disgusted and that's the best i can do that's
absolutely cause at least it's non fiction at least there's something substantive about it you know what i mean what are you gonna do watch the king of pop documentary on msnbc again seriously do we not know what happened with michael jackson that's the thing you live your life in public and then people want to see a documentary about it i
it's so much fun and uh i barely call it work although everybody does work really hard on it monday and tuesday we shoot the the tv show we rehearse wednesday thursday friday but monday and tuesdays when we actually shoot it and we shoot for
a lot of work and the kids on the show work really hard so um but you just you know when you come to
it made it way easier sometimes you can do it with special effects but we just figured we knew these kids
scenes like that on tv shows they shoot
the cast who comes in and everybody comes in and does it all together does the scene
he's got allergies and he's flying along carrying me in his claws and he and he sneezes and drops me and i land on a deserted island and even though he's my pet and i've raised him since he was a teeny little chick and
um in my backpack that'd be good i would uh want a uh desalinization machine takes the salt out of
a combo one of those survival hatchets that come
the compass in the end um so that i could uh split trees and build a house and that kinda stuff uh
just to so i could eat it right away and miss it the whole time or so i could just wait and not eat it for a long time and be very sad
right or i you know what i could do is if it's a lollipop if i like a sucker right just a regular sucker if i lick it long enough to where it's smooth i could use it like a magnifying glass and when the sun passes through it i could focus the point on something and i could start a fire with it the same way you do
i think it would be way better if the earth was either um like shaped like a a
okay it'll just take a second i just have to give them my spiritual routines in the interview my pr person is worried about my spiritual routines they don't
yeah yeah yeah and i brush its teeth and comb its hair and floss uh my spirit and uh and then i put it back in and i go about my day and then at night i take my spirit out and i hang it on the rack so that it doesn't get
because if you set your drink on a real hollywood star walk of fame uh it the
left it is now a weekly show um it could only sustain five days of funny when i was on there
you want you want to be my first drink um clarification might be in order i'm i'm not into any kind of weird stuff in that regard um yes uh the truth is i've never had an alcoholic
life uh i'm not going to start but thank you uh i'll be your designated driver though i'm not above that uh although uh if if you're looking for some action though i if you've been drinking i won't sleep with you uh you have to be sober for that kinda action i put in way too much work uh for you to sleep through half of it i'm not gonna do that i want you to
speak chinese i don't read chinese i'm like a six year old
i've been speaking for about five years now i really haven't learned to read i'm going to shanghai in the fall for uh almost a month so i'm hoping that uh i'll be able to
a lot more reading there um i'm like a you know i'm like a six year old i could yap my
basically like uh being sealed in a sandwich bag um it was cool cause it and you know i had the purple hood so that was kind of a style difference but there were no vents cut in the whole thing so every time i would
friend of his pregnant um i don't know that he's getting her pregnant i don't think he'll be anywhere near the vicinity i mean i think it's pretty much just leave a deposit uh on the door and i'll pick it up later um kind of a circumstance i you know quite frankly if it was gonna happen this is the only way uh the only way clay aiken was ever gonna have a
dozens of women in their early fifties who would turkey baster clay aiken's uh baby
um yeah it it wouldn't even be it i mean ayesha would have a really good shot cause i don't hit girls but if she picked up a weapon it would be a different game altogether
and uh she's tough she really is she's tough as nails but she's soft in all the right places
he it would be like bruce lee fighting uh kareem abdul jabbar in game of death uh but i would still win i might have a big footprint on my chest at the end of it but i would
it's still early but um yeah it's great to be in liverpool and doing mcm in liverpool
i i i just feel so lucky to be able to go to work every day and do something that i
has comedy in it but when when that happened it was it was a it was a big it was a big blow as well
for which was the the people that were really good fans that when we were when we were actually in our heyday
cgi work was um done with rex and they had an animatronic
group make sure we were looking at the same place 'cause otherwise that is gonna look a bit dodgy and also
her ego is fueled by her twitter followers she has like
more twitter followers than the population of venezuela or something like that and she's having a bit of a breakdown and she's making a comeback she's a pop star she's making a comeback in two thousand and fifteen and um yeah her name is poppy and she's great fun to play she's a
yeah it's one of the things that really drew me initially to the project because of the parallels and
my life right now and yeah i found that really really interesting um hopefully i'm not as um divaesque as she is um cause she's a proper diva but um yeah i like to think that i'm not quite as um a head case as she is
um famous uh pop stars and you kind of um get
and yeah i look to britney spears and also um
um yeah across the board really um i think sort of everybody out there has had one sort of
uh its um it's amazing to be working um at the langham one of which i love working in the west end in town cause it's so convenient um and two it's just uh prestigious amazing posh hotel that is just lovely to
be working in and also we get to use one of the rooms as our dressing room so that's also quite nice um above all our space that we perform in is um an absolute treat it's a really really intimate space and
and it's got a cabaret feel and it's dark and it's kind of got cool sexy lighting and yeah it's a really really um lovely lovely setting and it's there you know and you don't have to sort of
and um yeah and it's there you don't have to kind of make things up and make a set it's just all
um i my main thing that i i find really interesting about the project is the i hope the audience feel literally like a fly on the wall when they're watching
that really really translates i'm sure it does because we a pretty much on top of the audience it's like uh a tin of sardines basically um i don't quite know how our audience manages to get in the rooms following our our play because our room is almost twice as big
um on top of that i hope that they take away um a nice nice experience um you know we've got a
few different elements in there we got music and um different time periods the audience get taken on a journey throughout the hotel um and also from two thousand and fifteen right back into the past so um it's a really interesting concept and i'm really happy
her ego is fueled by her twitter followers she has like a
more twitter followers than the population of venezuela or something like that and she's having a bit of a breakdown and she's making a comeback she's a pop star she's making a comeback in two thousand and fifteen and um yeah her name is poppy and she's great fun to play she's a
in my life right now and yeah i found that really really interesting um hopefully i'm not as um divaesque as she is um cause she's a proper diva but um yeah i like to think that i'm not quite as um a head case as she is
famous uh pop stars and he would kind of um get
and yeah i looked at britney spears and also
um yeah across the board really um i think sort of everybody out there has had one sort of
it's um it's amazing to be working um at the langham one of which i love working in the west end in town 'cause it's so convenient um and two it's just
that prestigious amazing posh hotel that is just lovely to
be working in and also we get to use one of the drip rooms is our dressing room so that's also quite nice um but above all our space that we perform in is um an absolute treat it's a really really intimate space and
cozy and it's got a cabaret feel and it's dark and it's kind of got cool sexy lighting and yeah it's a really really um lovely lovely setting and it's there you know and you don't have to sort of
and um yeah and it's there you don't have to kind of make things up and make a set it's just
and um my main thing that i i find really interesting about the project is that i hope the audience feel literally like a fly on the wall when they're

um on top of that i hope that they take away um a nice nice experience um you know we've got a few uh few different elements in there we got
and um different time periods the audience get taken on a journey throughout the hotel um and also from two
fifteen right back into the past so um it's a really interesting concept and i'm really
tonight we start rehearsing in a week um so that'll be fun to go down memory lane
the the um repertoire and the music and all that for that um yeah it's gonna be great to be back with the guys and getting out there on such a major scale and the combination of both is is really
hey i'm not promising that we're new and improved but they can expect a blast from the past and it's it's about celebration and it's about
some is is about giving them the music that they listened to when they were growing up you know a lot of the fans have said that it's the soundtrack to their childhood which is lovely to hear and yeah it's about getting them to there again and enabling them to come out and remember what it was what you know what the world was like when they were eight years old and reminisce and um have a night of
i my my favorite track is don't stop moving it's one of my um all time favorites across the board it's always
my favorite also i heard a cover of it today which has probably been out for a while that i've never heard of before by the beautiful south um tom who plays my manager um played it just before we went out for a show and it's actually quite
i did this duet with george and when i was in nashville i went and bought a pair of boots that i wanted him to sign and i said hey man would you mind signing my
said i don't i don't know if i wanna do that you know his wife said george he said sign your boots not shine
who's career is based on on record sales you know i mean i'd like to sell as many
as i can that's part that's part of it but my career's never really been as dependent on record sales as sort of the whole you know performing
component of it but um i don't really i don't really keep track of that you know
yeah yeah yeah see what i'm saying i screw everything up now if i can do this interview over again i'd say how important my
yeah he he ran against them in in sixty nine and lost and then ran against them again in seventy two
little bit from what i understand it was i was just a a small kid but apparently he had he had some
he's a musical guy but he wasn't a musician and my mom i think probably had definitely had some musicians on her side but they all lived they all came from new york so
old the first time i played was at my my dad's uh campaign headquarters opening my mom really wanted me to play you know how a lot of times a parent will kinda push you on stage to
um but the the prodigy part man you know that's something that uh there it it it had been said but i never sorta subscribed to that that
else all i did all day was play the piano and sing and and in that way it was probably
the creative arts and uh ellis was a teacher there in in uh as a part of the public school system down there and and wynton and branford and all of these guys came through uh ellis's tutelage and it was amazing cause he's he's the best teacher i ever had
i mean i born in sixty seven so by the time i came up you know that
it's just it's just different like my generation didn't think about it too much and the older generation you you mentioned aaron neville before what a great guy he is man those guys were always so supportive i think they could tell
musicians' village you mentioned branford marsalis before and branford and i were we would
uh houses in total and it's going great we've had like twenty thousand
from all over the world come down and build and these houses are one hundred percent
the bill so we're so grateful for for all of those people
i i that's the last thing on my mind the first thing on my mind is to try to actually do something and this project is really become a
new york right outside of new york actually and i heard that it was gonna hit on a saturday and i was concerned about the welfare of my family so but i couldn't get in touch with anybody cause all the phone lines were down well uh the storm kinda came and went and missed new orleans it didn't really hit new orleans the next day i turn on the news and the levees i don't know if you guys know that new orleans is shaped like a like a bowl and most of the residential area is in that lower part it's actually twenty feet below
and you know all of that water came in it just filled up this bowl um and it and
talking about people don't realize how big new orleans is you talking about hundreds of thousands of homes and and and
hundreds of thousands of people no it was terrible i mean like you you found yourself in these my my aunt jessie and uncle john my aunt jessie's probably seventy one my uncle john's probably eighty one and they they were on
that they're they had to come rescue them by a boat next thing you know they're on the interstate trying to hitchhike
yeah and they have money i mean the people who didn't have money uh oh i could go on and on about the things i saw it was very very confusing must have been real confusing
yeah it's really you know new york is great uh san francisco's great there's a lot of wonderful places in the states but there's no place like new
again i i hope people if they do decide maybe for holiday to go to the states that they visit cause not only is it still a wonderful place but new orleans really needs that they need that influx of of tourism
well we had a piano in the house and i started playing much like a lot of children do they started plinking around uh when i was about three years old but i don't think i was doing
think i'm doing anything remarkable now but uh as time went on uh i started getting lessons in
then they have music in the afternoon so my parents would take me down and i'd play and when i was nine years old i did my first record and then i recorded my second record the one you
october twentieth it would be we would touring around the uk we end up at the albert hall on november
glasgow uh oh jeez i'm i'm trying to remember all the places we're playing they have to show me the
cause we did two shows on a wednesday one thursday night one friday night two saturday and two sunday so i had two two days off i had monday and tuesday just to sorta decompress and spend time with my
weeks i said i gotta burn out at some point i can't maintain this enthusiasm
was was uh has nothing to do with the song uh and then i'm about to do a film with uh renee zellweger which i haven't even met her yet so i'm excited
uh i i i think uh this this guy has no no filter at all um and that's what was so fun to play uh uh about uh this character but i i try to use my filter as much as i
not not to change the content of what i'm saying but just to make sure that you know i think being polite is is an important virtue
uh to jerry to all of them lisa kudrow the whole cast really um is an extraordinarily talented group of people and it was amazing to show up to work and
and you know have all of these people around it was a very sort of an energetic set and uh
a good spirited set uh you know kathy bates being there i mean any day that you wake up and you know you're gonna work with somebody well not somebody like but you're gonna work with kathy bates is is
scene with such a great girl and a great actress such as hillary uh was something i'll i'll never forget i mean it was a a
you know i don't really have a baseball team but i you know cause i grew up in new orleans and we don't have a team
do um i write more emails than i do handwritten letters but yeah i've i've written quite a few letters to my wife i i i like receiving letters you know my dad's always been a big letter writer my mother was a letter writer and i like the way that feels you know
there was some down time while they were relighting something and i went over to the piano and played and had a had a good time it was it was
more and even better uh this time around so it it was more of an excitement
yeah yeah no um i mean all all that is to me i look at it as just part of
for me i always try like i don't go around wearing you know magnus's uh jacket all the time you
and there's something there that i think both of them can't really quite understand uh yet
uh i don't think that's like the reason why it's attractive but it's like this mystery that he wants to uh get to know and from there
slowly ask questions and then figure a person out and i think what he was seeing was was intriguing and
um i think it's different from what you've seen in the trajectory of of season one but it goes back to uh
you know the writers it was more of him trying to figure out how different tactics to try and get to talk to
to uh pull as much information uh about the character and about the world and and there comes a time with
it's not just about the world is ending but about the relationships which is i i think what we're really getting
miscommunication as well so you you will see that with not everyone's just holding hands and hoping
i think with with magnus is what i find really interesting about him is that he does know so much and he he usually will know how things will play out but he will allow them
special effects wise and and both of us kinda meet in the middle and with that it it it is playing around with with the
not not within the lines but how the scene gets played out cause so i look at movement that way as well but um so there's variations and i i think they they chose the
alec is going through a lot um right now i uh
and i think the important part is that kind of messed up with uh alec and jase that
and with with with everything going on at the institute and his and his
pushing him down and saying like he can't do certain things i think it's messing with him so when magnus
objects that mean so much to him that kinda come about and you'll you'll get a lot more backstory on it and it'll
uh uh a deeper look into how that effects everyone
and you're like okay well that had its window and it's done and but to see people's
pretty you know that's why i i or even if they're not if they're married by then it's still a story that's really
how do i get back into that without like fully prepping because you know you bounce out a project i kinda just let it go
i i think for me it also helps with conversations you know you wanna multitask but it
utilizes dance in the way that i i i love you know and i love and other things i'll just stay as like an a viewer
and love love dance watching it but uh i'm excited for these um couple projects that are coming up that i'll definitely be
so it's it's been nice to have a lot you know have a lot of them kinda follow in my career and and you know what what's been great it's like oh man i you know i wasn't i would never have
a little more about oh what did magnus like who are his relationships that he had before uh his friendships and the mentor uh uh when he was a mentor he still is and i think that's what's what's really fun and he
in season one and i think that's what's fun that's what todd and darren are
they do they're really trying to draw out the relationships um and not just uh the romantic ones but the ones outside of it just cause it's um that that that's what that's what's really that's what really uh gives you an inside
this i mean he's he's used to kind of maybe feeling a little bit of an outsider as as
his his powers and also his confidence but um
the what he brings to the simon role is um is really special and every
that people all over the world are watching it and some of ya'll should be sleeping or studying or being in school
and seeing that for magna is like even being in in that party sequence and
we were like sometimes reshooting certain certain episodes so we kinda lose track of which episode things uh that happen in certain episodes like
is easy to obtain something that you know the props department does a really good job of making these props and i think they did a brilliant job with the seraph blade it's just like
of art that i would like to hang and even you know i'm not i don't play a shadowhunter but just seeing that and being
a lot i mean there's gonna be a lot of malec there's gonna be um a lot
challenging uh things that that that will happen just like with any you know any relationship that
the mess that's happening i think with within the down world and and and the shadow world and um
that that i think plays really well with these almost they're they're basically opposites you know um and they're completely opposite and then it's like opposites attract and then finding out like why that happens and i think we get to see
oh i'm not i try i did this other interview where they had us try and do it as fast as we could with like no
other interview where they had us try and do it as fast as we could with
i think you know you you especially from where it was back even from you know when when film uh and television started it's it's gotten a lot better obviously but it's now making sure those voices are are they're
in the the writer's room and and execs and then directors are are are able to understand you know the voices that need to be heard
there's still a lot of work in that sense but i'm really happy to just you know see a lot of familiar faces on television
and uh is also you know been around the block and and done things whether it be you know in
uh the so it it's it's a really fun character that that that that has so many layers and and and and i can go so many different directions with it so i really
well totally it's a lot darker and and we we're also uh
well so you know we're filling in where the books kind of left a lot of space in so there's a lot of uh uh uh uh places where we're gonna look deeper into the background of of of our main characters and also bring in new characters that people from the book lovers have fell in love with and i think even people who haven't read the book will fall in love with just cause it brings it strikes a a a kind of
uh uh uh jolts up the the the the kind of the um the storyline that that's that was going through when the
what's what's nice about the show is um is everyone is awesome everyone is is really sweet and and nice and and you know wants to make the show the best as possible um you know
think that uh you just have to watch some films single by thirty is out right now to binge
thirty's out right now to binge watch on uh uh uh youtube red and shadowhunters comes out january second follow me on at harry
due to um a great friend of mine at school um he was on grange hill which is a telly program and i was so
heard her name and then i looked it up on the yellow pages with the eight you know phone directory and then phoned her up and said i want to be an actress
later a review was a hit now you can't ever manufacture a hit you'll either have one or you won't at that point i wanted to go to university and get a proper education for myself it was my father who was much more um
i said no no no no you've got a hit that will never that will necessarily not might not ever happen you know you have to capitalize on that so carry on you can go to university if you feel strongly about that later on in your life of course you never will
and uh so i just carried on and i just carried on working i didn't go to drama school
to um meet a lot of young people these days who'll they'll come after you at uni or or even don't really know what to do at eighteen and i go like start working now i think work experience is paramount and just doing it you learn a huge
acting have an imagination cause all you're doing is being a big
very vulnerable when it comes to acting and be very emotional but at the same time when you're well known you have to be very um have a
a stronger armor and make sure that you don't believe too much of about what other people
ultimately you're self employed you're gonna have to work out if you're the kind of character who will suit that kind of
life and have the discipline to deal with it cause what it's not when you're working that's hard it's when you're not working and you gotta have have a
anyone don't you know punish yourself don't spend too much on yesterday that was a good quote i you know don't waste too much
was um that was in a way that was the first time that i was well superficially different i i was um not english i was nova
it was i mean i like doing something personally from my and i think i like most
well i personally prefer parts that require me to change even if it's a superficial sort of physical change and um
oh they they have not so much in the english patient but in other sort of period costume dramas they sort of say so and so's playing the helena bonham
actress usually kate winslet or something like that you know i've hit thirty so i think they'll uh well big hit well i'm an aging i read
cause i i preferred playing um i think the parts will get better i hope
it's a nova scotia accent the whole story takes place in cape britain and uh the accent is very odd because one um well it's a hybrid of sort of mixtures of canadian sounds and irish sounds all of those are scottish decent so god knows why they sound irish but they do and so it can sound if you're doing it right it can sound as if you're doing two accents badly but that's if you're doing it right
floated you know halfway across the world in the accent from time to time but uh it sounded sort of authentic cause it sounds so widely
i i i had i had difficulty for instance understanding what the hell i said during that scene but um it is an
house sort of i have a great fun here probably because i don't live here so
uh it's uh no i love it i mean there are different parts of america i do you know the
make it seem as if it's it's original and it's a brainwave and newly mint it and make it
a cliche not seem a cliche like seem instantly like it seems if it's it's original and it's a brain wave and newly minted and make it fresh so
pumpkin why pumpkin so then it was like well she's obviously improvising let's do that so she's got to have lots of vegetables and maybe the pumpkin isn't
point when it's almost does not turn into the pumpkin at the basically the idea was i just thought maybe she's erratic maybe she's not
necessarily the most accomplished or efficient fairy godmother she's she's she was described in the thing as being a hundred and seventy thousand years old so i said well she's going to have some sort of memory loss add to that you know she's gotta she's got a lot of pressure
headline to make very quick so we're the pressure of that and then also
onto the set because it took us so long to get ready both me and lily uh so and when lily got into the dress finally that i
she's part designer too um it took us so long to get into
underneath my skirts and switch me on because i was actually a walking lamp i had four hundred led lights
and i had to be switched on for each take and sometimes there was a malfunction and we'd get cut
yup and uh florence i had a little bulge in up my sleeve up my up my skirts it was it was a really different kind of
the kids are you know gonna be entertained now i can just lie back and relax and you know not have am i bored you know what do i do now
i mean not all my fault but you know being pestered by the kids but in fact they go they come out really enchanted
and you know and interested everyone knows the story and somehow when ken said oh
it's classic but i think there's a maturity of character um
and a lot of messages are totally appropriate to twenty fifteen as it were as they were appropriate to any age that you live in i if you have got the guts
sadness and grief and basically a lot of crap happening to you you feel the gap
and remain courageous and decide to not be embittered and twisted and not be a
disappointed or angry but but remain open and grow
then you can choose that but you have a choice in life how to react to
one of the moments i really liked best was at james lafferty's charity basketball game um bethany joy lenz asked me to sing the national anthem with her and so you know i used to sing the national anthem in my hometown where i grew up and my dad was like the commissioner of lower loudoun little league baseball and so i'd
so i sang it with her um and then that morning my best friend elizabeth anwar who plays shelly on our show showed up she's an amazing singer so she joined in our little group so it
was me and and two of my very good friends getting to perform for our fans and it was just something really different than what we do on our show um but still getting to
i had on the show um i have to say this year a lot of my storyline has been revolving
he was played by matt barr who is by far the nicest man on the planet
our scene i think i'd done like a spoof shower scene before wearing like a shower cap it was definitely not sexy and so this is like my my first
and he plays whitey he's always asking for hair touch ups and always demanding new wardrobe no um i think i mean we've all been together so long
how do you say this we don't guard ourselves around each other so if someone's acting like a baby which it's usually me uh none of us are afraid
four years later which is great because what's happened over the course of our show is that everyone's become a good guy you know every bad guy you've seen the justification as to why he's a bad guy and you feel sorry for them so what i would love to happen is to come back four years
producers on the show um down in wilmington called southern gothic films and
our goal is to to keep film and to keep projects in north carolina cause it really is such an awesome place to shoot and i feel really lucky that i've gotten to spend at least four years down there um and so yeah we've got projects under development that you know we're we're looking for financing right now and i'm learning a lot about the independent film world and i've gotten a really great education both at mtv and at one tree hill so i feel like i can utilize that in a
it's gotta be my favorite tv show until i was older um and it's freaks and geeks i think judd apatow is
and actually in the time we've had off since shooting we've been watching the box set of his other
caught watching top model now and then um i love the drama of it all i love
oh well you know what any time white collar does a
it's go big or go home um and i think the that perhaps this season has been a little more dramatic um i think the tension between
other than the first two seasons there are feelings invested in one another you know friendship carries a lot of weight and so um the choices that
or peter um and so there's a lot of consequences this season and i think we're gonna see that in the
one that's a type a and you're a type a and you're wildly attracted to each other there's gonna be tension um i think there's gonna be a little bit of competition
and there's also gonna be a lot of heat and so they certainly are gonna continue to path uh cross paths because they've been doing it for years um and so it's
very good time together and um i think our characters have fun together my character allows the audience to see a side of him that was only hinted at when he was with kate you know he had a domestic side with kate that uh you only saw in a little tiny flashback and so my job is to show the audience what they wanna see of neil you know the suave charming kind
meal um date ken if you will so um you know i
i think the way we left it where sara lets him know that
um we see sara being protective of him and and clearly that indicates that she still cares for him what
he's been doing a very good job of gracefully navigating this
and um my nanny and i used to watch it together and we used to joke you know oh i wanna be
cause the usa tagline is characters welcome um so when this audition came around it was like you know i wasn't really
here is uh a facilitator for the other characters you know sara opens up a door for you to see a different side of neil a different side of
bridget she came in rough and hard and stoic um and
we've gotten to see her break those defense mechanisms down a little bit and i
um the breakup scene between her and neil was important because i don't know if even neil knew how committed sarah was to the relationship i maybe even it surprised her
you know she might've gotten just caught up um and taken by surprise at how disappointed she was when she found out about the treasure and so it would be
be honest with each other no secrets and and create a friendship
maybe turns into something um you know if they're not together as a couple but still in each other's world him having to watch her date other people or her having to watch him date other people
that this show is that there's always that underlying subplot that goes throughout the episodes but each episode is like great big huge fantastic stories so it's nice the juxtaposition of the the big storyline that's about the case per episode and then kind of this underlying thing that colors how the characters
for the for the folks that have been watching since day one and it's also you know a payoff for people that might casually just tune in for the first time you know
um i think that what was hard for me is that we didn't know all summer uh while we had our hiatus who he was gonna pick and realistically
eight he's gonna get bored again and he's gonna do it all over again um
well yeah and this is somebody who i wasn't totally familiar with but then the more i studied him i was like oh my god i can't believe this is like john doe he's coming this is gonna be great so he shows up and he
became this great big part of my heart and then you know she passed away it affected
sort of find out what she was like at peyton's age is really interesting and um and yeah it's cool to have him
cause there are definitely the kids in the camp that like hate hate me they're like oh man she gets all our
and she's the worst and she's a terrible friend and and peyton's pretty much a villain for the great
villain is they don't think they're the villain they think everything they're doing is justified and totally right so i would love to be able to play the dan part and uh and apply that that same mindset
so it's awesome and we've gotten to kind of stay outside of the madness for six years now and my whole family lives here and so i get to be like normal when i'm not
up to me and she's like i have to tell you something i don't want it to freak you out and i think she's gonna tell me i know where you live because that freaks me out you know
so this girl walks up she's like i have to tell you something she said i saw you getting in your car this other day and i saw a flesh spirit in the passenger seat of your car and i'm like
spirit sitting in my passenger seat and she describes verbatim the woman that haunts my house i have pictures of this woman she describes i mean to a t what this woman looks like and i'm just
it precisely that actually i think well that's one of the reasons it was definitely um um different for me in that it's not a really dramatic piece you know i love doing drama but it was definitely an opportunity for me
you never know what's gonna happen tomorrow and um and i could i could certainly relate to holly trying to find her
we yes we did freedom writers it came out this year as well and um we um
rules girl and i wanna show this side of you and um and neither of us really
thought of ps i love you as the next thing um and then
you know warner brothers kept saying what do you wanna do and i just kept saying peace i love you and then richard had written it so it was kind of just a natural
but what a what a great opportunity to to to experience it like that and get to stay for a
i did i did drink yes i'm leaving for the for ireland tomorrow for the premier there
really fun he's um you know he he got into the business a little later in life so
he's really playful and that he doesn't have kind of any expectations of about how anything's supposed to be and he just kind of finds his way and um there's a lot of playfulness and
i'm so lucky you know you don't get movies like that anymore really um and to to to have such a strong cast you know around around me and to collaborate with them uh you know it was it was it was not only fun it
oh you should warn us so that we can think about it um okay um i'll
great love story and again another movie i think about uh that really
so interesting to hear you say that it's the second time i've heard nominated for an academy
it means to me that i'm being recognized for my work in a movie that i'm very proud to be a part of um it means that people are
really being drawn to the movie and um recognizing the importance of the movie and it's very
cause it obviously opened a lot of career opportunities for me um i'm getting the chance to work with a lot of talented people um which is very very exciting and that's that's also one of the pluses about being nominated for an oscar and getting that that that high accolade is that you get those opportunities more
you know i've absolutely with with other job opportunities but just even across the board without even job opportunities i've had people call me and write me directors producers actresses people i don't even know reaching out and uh
um how the movies moved them and the performance has inspired them and um
i can't like i can't even tell you how that makes me feel um to have that much support and the public the public comes up to me i was just talking about this with one of my friends they stop me on
whose work i admire and and someone who i i admire as a human being i mean she's been around a long time and um
and so admirable i mean she's an amazing talent and to i think be outwardly honest with those
in a in a business that i think that a lot of people talk about you know where people aren't supportive of one another and they're out to get one another i think that um her being so open about that just shows the type of human being she
they offered it to me i knew that if i couldn't pass as a boy that i didn't wanna do the movie i knew i'd be doing it a grave injustice i mean this was someone's life
you know and um i wanted to be able to tell the story in a way that one brandon would be proud of and in a way
in uh which brandon lived i mean brandon passed as a boy and people believed he was a boy um so i uh
it's uh when i see that i just i think about brandon so much that it was someone brandon was someone who was living his life the way he wanted and um this movie i think means so much to me it's a love story and it's a a coming of age story and it's it's a movie that uh is about following your dreams and i think that that's why people are relating to it and when i
mattered i don't think she thought of it in those types of things like am i gonna get caught or i think that she he was just saying this is how i wanna live this was what feels good this was what brings me the most joy and i have so much
helped but the but but really the passing wasn't the biggest uh help on for me the most instrumental passing
um what it's like to live as a transgender person
a gay and lesbian in in this world that's full of
was made for under two million dollars we all did it for the it was a labor of love we did it because of the importance of it and that we all wanted to be a part of it no one was getting paid to do this movie and um it
uh you know being the underdogs and getting this this attention is it's just thrilling and it's exciting and i think it um speaks a lot about where we're
well meryl streep is my acting role model i've always admired her she is my acting god and i've said that before i think she's just absolutely incredible i almost get disinspired when i
i i i don't think there's a word to define it i i don't know what it is it's a quality and a luminescence and a realness that she brings and all these characters that she develops they're so real and i don't know how she does it i watch it and i
how are you doing that you believe that that is that person and that when you meet her you're gonna meet be meeting these characters
i'm doing a movie called the gift um it's a supporting role and a and an amazing ensemble cast sam raimi is directing cate blanchett uh giovanni ribisi greg kinnear michael jeter keanu reeves katie holmes i mean it's an amazing cast um it's a murder mystery it's very fun i'm i'm filming
sorry maybe we should just think about you're gonna have to i'm just doing this so you have to say that to me three
this was extensive there's there's a lot of different accounts that you can read about this this time and and and the settlers of this country i'd say four mothers because like you said this movie um i believe deals with something very different than we've seen in film
you know this is a fictional movie yet it is almost a true story in a way because this is a true account of what we've we've dealt with um the resiliency of of
uh to understand truly what these people experienced day in and day out as they traversed across the state
really set the stage for why these people can lose their minds and really lose sense of of any type of
and and they didn't have the wherewithal to be able to handle um that as as as we do
ordinary someone first of all he's a veteran in this business he's been doing this for so long and he knows the ropes inside and out and so for me to get the
who's who's who's the director and costar working so closely that kind of symbiotic thing that you have um and
you're here and it it's i didn't want it to be over it was it was
well i think funding any film can be a challenge um but that might be more of a question for tommy lee only because i wasn't a producer on this movie um but i can just say thank you to all those people for funding it so that we could get this this little movie that could up and and and running i think it
it's um gives people a nice choice besides going to a
it gives people a nice slice of life and as an audience member um when i go and see movies i like to have those options i wanna see a slice of life and and and
uh comedy and the big movies i want my my choices so it's nice that we're out there
the the script was was great the script was kind of it was amazing story to read but it
went to chatham for research to um and the place where it took place and they still they still have it's kind of like a museum piece that the actual thirty six five hundred boat that uh that they rescued all the guys on that day well it's uh still tied to chatham
that that would even be a legal let alone having
no no and it what i find so fascinating is how humble these guys were it's like i've listened to a few interviews with bernie webber and he
he he always mentions it being like an act of god or or most likely it was fate or an act of god you know totally taking the responsibility out of his hands which um i just think that's i mean it's so humbling to see to hear someone who is so humble and but has achieved
yeah it was no the only thing that was hard about looking into chris' eyes actually is because his eyes are so blue
um first rehearsal we both kind of immediately fell in love with the relationship between bernie and miriam because just the idea of that they met over the phone
knew what each of them looked like and and had such an such a particularly miriam had such a instinct towards the relationship and it um you know and they would they would
yeah so i met and i was privileged enough to get my tour around chatham was from uh patty who is miriam and bernie's daughter who um miriam was quite quite uh private apparently uh so
like to kind of to to to share that way and listening to her own voices um um but patty just the even you know uh she i don't think patty quite understands how much help she gave me because she was just telling me basic things about her mum but it's just the the words that
to explain someone that's so close to them just means so much and after meeting patty i really did this character of miriam totally like popped off the
steady kind of progression i feel very lucky that i've managed i've had chance to play
interesting women that i've been completely intrigued by um i think for me i when i played bonnie from bonnie and clyde i felt i sort of felt like the years before that had been like my
sort of a this sort of learning the manipulation and so and and so i didn't feel after i finished that miniseries i was like
um it's i mean it's such an epic feat that
the scale of the of the boat and the managing to save so many people it kind of it i feel like it's quite a life affirming
yeah i mean this is a story that i hadn't had not previously been aware of and i
the kind of the morals and the values represented by um
um by bernie webber and by the by the coast guards it's uh it's it's the you know the hearing bernie webber afterwards after the events he's so humble and
know so this is just his job and this is just what he's out there to do and
of loyalty to your job and um you know bravery in the face of danger and the the altruism in being able to put your life at stake to save other people and uh and know so strongly that that is what's right and to be able to stick
yeah i mean hugely i had i sort of had no real knowledge of the of the coast guard beforehand and i kind of it uh you know always naively assumed it was quite a sort of just offshore thing and to kind of
i mean it was stepping on the on the thirty six five hundred itself cause they still have the the the actual boat tied up at chatham pier and it's tiny it's like a teeny sort of thing
this can fit a handful of people is that how and how the hell do you save like how the hell does nearly forty people fit on it and in such stormy weather um and
the uh the sets were amazing i mean i cause i went in the real chatham coast guard office um before we started shooting but and then my first day of shooting was in the set of that
i mean it was it was set out in the same way it was just kind of it just had the same the same scale and the same feel and and which kind of really kind of totally transports you back to that time
and and then it's gonna be so different from the rest of the studio which was just like i've
studio set of of such like epic proportions this was they built an entire
to to create what you see in the movie out of you know this
this gurney of a of a ship and kind of a a a large pool of like three foot deep water
i think all i feel like almost the location as well as the weather kind of have their own characters to play in this movie almost um because cape cod is uh chatham is a beautiful like picture postcard um village but there's something about cape cod because it's so it's so open a lot of it is is quite flat and quite open that you really feel the elements and so uh you know it's it's
soon as the sun sets the temperature drops and and the you know on a windy day you can really feel it there's no kind there is no kind of shelter and i think being there and feeling that kind of just reminds you every minute of of
you know of uh such a proportion that two tankers broke in half
i auditioned and i was incredibly excited about going to the audition because it was basically going to be me sat in a room with kenneth branagh going through scenes and playing for a few hours um and uh that's why i was incredibly excited cause i already knew that cate blanchett was attached and kenneth branagh was directing and it's cinderella and the script was so
you're kind of classic and traditional it just seemed like um um um a movie that was gonna be
ken kind of encouraged us to be silly and to be over the top and um
well i mean he initially encouraged us to kind of ground the performance in some sort of um reality for
psychology of the sisters and create a backstory and then once that was established it was there was a sense of of kind of play of just push it as far as you can go be as silly as you can go and uh it's fine cause we can always rein it in if it's too much cause it never
epic and grand there really was particularly in the ball scenes there really was this kind of sense of of of magic that goes into that process um and i think we we filmed at pinewood studios which i think was perfect for this movie cause is there is that really kind of sense of old school kind of history and glamour um to pinewood um and
agreed they're either that they're either sixteen year old girls or toddlers in fact the the ages that they're that they're kind of like so self absorbed that they can't see anything outside of
needs and desires and wants and they have no uh sympathy they have just they just have no empathy um at all and i and and no consideration for anyone else um
um but i um i don't think i i don't think i can cast my mind back to a time that um when i was a little toddler in my own little center of the universe but i do um uh i did kind of i have a few mates that uh
base the sibling rivalry on that kind of on that experiencing
that kind of sibling rivalry growing up that kind of love hate relationship
lilly in the the blue ball dress 'cause i'd seen the i'd seen the
um um in the costume uh house but and it was a beautiful dress on the mannequin but it wasn't until lily was in it and i sophie and i pulled up in a car to see lily stepping out of the makeup trailer and it just it it was the first time that i
i'm in a disney movie i'm we're making cinderella because there is cinderella and i felt i think i felt more starstruck seeing lily in the blue dress than i did me
and see her work is amazing and then to be part of that and um she brings such
and and truth to a scene that whenever you go in a scene with her you kind of
you kind of you feed off that there's no there's nowhere there's no escape you have to believe believe in it
he understands the kind of the acting process and so he therefore i feel like
ask quite a lot from you and that uh that makes it feel quite um quite fun and quite fulfilling to work with him because he's not afraid to kind of to push you and push you uh um
you feel like he knows that he'll get it from you if if if he he asks you in the right way and that kind of like
uh so everyday everday on set with kent feels like a bit of an acting workshop actually um yeah of kind of trying new things trying it differently
now i know more about it it it seems like a very hard job i think i'd have to have a story that i wanted to tell to want to direct rather than it being i want to direct and i'm gonna find a story
she found out somehow that our team listens to it in the locker room to kind of pep us up right and so she was so kind to send us like a
and she'd sent this memo to us and she said you guys i have some advice for you just go out there
the droop freeze surgery it was potentially career ending um i had to gamble whether or not i wanted to do surgery prior to the world cup because i knew i may not make it back in time
excruciating just the pain i went through um eleven anchors in the shoulder
i got through the world cup with many of shots a lot of
no yeah rumors go so fast but yeah um i'm getting an mri
my goalkeeper coach paul rogers he's intense he strikes the ball probably ninety miles per hour and it probably broke my wrist off one of
then the final game against japan so in the quarterfinal game i decided to read their approach and you can read the angle whether they're going to open up their hips or not so it's more of an educated guess i like to think that i'm
to take a different approach an approach that i wanted to do my entire career had it ever gone into a
and i told myself um you know after many discussions with my
absolutely and i have to say that the nation really was behind this american team and i think it was just that the fight that we showed as a team the american fighting
be opposed to it and i think i think i'd be able to hang i don't think i'd be like the best goalkeeper by any means i'm not that arrogant and that naive but
middle finger up to everybody and say think what you want about me i am who i am but at the end of the day i'm an
for me was without controversy despite what anybody else thinks on the
i gave my opinion was the moment i branded myself as outspoken selfish and
in that room um i told him right then and there and you know what
coach there's nothing i can do about it but if anybody asks me i'm going to tell them that it
as soon as i started to get up he made sure to push me back in and told me i could leave when
every answer is set and there is no reason for me to really make
or so people who can't look at you can't ride up the elevator
you're using your father's debt as an excuse to to for people to feel sorry
i'm gonna have to ask you a question back and i wanna know why it's important
it's a new generation of players let's break free let's build a game and
i know that my play speaks for itself um i'm one of
away from all the hype away from all the media because we did have a task at hand to focus on coming back to the states we've really feel so much american spirit behind us and so much attention and so much just an amazing welcoming coming back to the states and we're just proud to be a part of it because we really feel like we are part of a historical moment and not just
playing defense and relying on our athleticism to put the ball out of his head to score and win games but we weren't possessing the ball we weren't creative on the attack but we did have the american fighting spirit so lo and
here comes the final sixty plus thousand people the pressure can amount the media coverage yet we played our best game we were attacking we had opportunities on the goal we played beautiful soccer like the game is meant to be played in the final so did we choke we played a beautiful game we played our best game but we didn't come out on top i don't think
fashion in a major tournament over pks is next to impossible and i think any soccer player would
this experience that i had um four years ago i wasn't able to enjoy the experience i was grieving i
i was going through my own situation fast forward four years later and truly i took a moment and i
then getting as far as we did i appreciated the fan support i appreciated the crowd i i appreciated that that the tournament was held
in a soccer environment in germany so i i really can take so much from this tournament this team was a fighting team we are a winning team i don't think we failed personally i'm gonna celebrate winning the silver you had two of the best teams everybody thought germany was gonna win the tournament they were out in the quarters so you have two two of the best teams germany and brazil out of the tournament and we won silver there is
want to turn the heads of the middle aged man you know if we want
for the game you know but i think if we wanna continue to grow our sport you can't just direct it at the young girls of course we want to build the game so that they can live up to their dreams but also i like to turn the heads of all of america that the sports fans'll like the minute
but two inches and i talk quite like him um i don't know i i'm not sure how similar i am obviously the the part of me have become uh connected very very strongly but uh i think my way of life is very very different at home i
no i don't have the the the heating bills the energy bills that he has to to pay but um
i was i felt very very honored because uh my great friend brendan coyle
all all so uh it was a great opportunity to come here and and visit albeit for a very short time so uh but i'm very excited to be seeing uh you know the
has taken us all by surprise those who make the television program and um you know we're we're we're thrilled but we never
to to to mushroom to develop in the way that it has and uh i've yet to hear of a a country
where it hasn't been popular it's even been shown in china i believe
and far east uh generally it's uh proved very popular so it's uh it's extraordinary it's an
in uh film television radio and theater i haven't done theater for a quite awhile
but uh i um um i i i love the performing arts i love i love the creativity of it i love
script so um while producers and directors want to employ
oh what dreams are left for me to reach ah oh well um uh plenty plenty uh i want to produce a film i'm hoping to produce a movie next year uh that's
finalized and um frankly to keep working i mean i am lucky enough to be in a profession where you don't retire uh
to uh shoot a film with george clooney uh he's doing a film at the moment in
germany uh called the monument men which is set in the second world war with uh matt damon and cate blanchett and i'm doing a a a small part in that um and
for me i'm doing a uh a children's or a family film in in england and um uh and then who knows maybe some more
uh what can i say to my for the fans here um all i want to say to the fans in spain is thank you um i i realize how popular the show has become here and all of us at downton abbey are very grateful thank you very
was head of the olympic uh deliverance commission and since
the the triumph of which he was a part he became very much the go to man for any corporate
his relationship with siobhan sharpe for instance uh from perfect curve who has been brought in
characters in in this new post uh particularly uh there are some significant characters like uh anna who is head of a output at the bbc whose really default setting
efficient um tracey pritchard um who is uh first and foremost a very skilled communications officer and second but equally
literally on its toes um and ian is very keen to get across the
twenty twelve which uh was obviously set against the backdrop of the olympics it wasn't really about satirizing the olympics it was really satirizing
structure and management speak and all the pitfalls of uh
and perhaps promoted to positions that they aren't really fully qualified to inhabit and i think the same flavor is there in w one a we're not uh deriding the bbc but we are mm uh having an uh an interesting look at the
which ranges i say from sort of hot desking to uh you know the way programs are put together but i think those i think the characters resonate through other
it's been structure and management speak and all the pitfalls of a a team trying to
and uh something or mass when actually everyone's sort of passing the buck and perhaps promoted to positions that they aren't really
the nhs or or even elements of whitehall i would imagine um you know the risks that are
part of their looks um jon morrison's style is very very specific so every um and uh and and odd word that you hear is not a mistake it's it's all there intentionally because jon has a fantastic ear for the absurdities of the way that we speak or try to communicate and usually fail to so
in the dialogue talking what appears to be nonsense but with great conviction and uh only on reflection do you realize that it was completely nonsense but everyone's left the room thinking they've achieved something most of the time they haven't um and trying to get that right is actually a lot
harder than it looks so we spend a lot of time pretty much holding hands in a circle of goodwill trying to get the uh the rhythm of the scenes right because it is rather orchestral i've said this before about twenty twelve john writes in a certain way that is very uh rhythmic and um
if if you lose the rhythm of the scene the whole thing sort of falls apart and you get sort of atonal chords in your in your orchestra um so we're we're always trying to to get that better so you you basically spend your entire day running
and it's uh it's in south east london near near greenwich or greenwich as you
and uh you know the the engine's slowing down a bit but they're still motoring and um uh i think the worst argument they ever had we were at a a a junction a t junction you know and uh dad said i think we turn right here pat and she said no it's left no pat it's right no it's left i

circumstances arise she um finally is forced to flee the castle and um ends up
uh allowing this power to to come out and
finds a way to sort of love who she is and
and then her sister anna finds uh sort of her path to forgiveness and
in the legacy of disney women i think she is she's different she's more complicated than a lot of
stereotypical villains um she's not a villain she's very conflicted and um
you know unfortunately or fortunately find a lot of similarities in my own
to elsa and um i sort of look at it as a gift that i could be inside of this
know even if you get more successful or things seem like things are really great on the outside
let the nerve set in and not be my total true self my best my
talented songwriters and musicians and they know how to write a great song and a memorable
um for me i can speak from uh just from my experience
you know it goes has this range and this place that it hits in all of my in in my voice and different textures and so that i can you uh
girls but it's for everybody i mean we all have to we all have all have to remind ourselves not to compromise who we are for other
and um life's too short you know and uh for the younger people you know i spent a lot of time um trying to hide the fact that i had this big voice cause i didn't want people not to like me or to think i was showing off and it wasn't till later in my life that i finally realized oh when you really allow yourself to be seen in this way
the more we love i mean i think they're just intertwined one hundred
i mean he's he's actually very sad though if you think about it this poor little guy
we don't know what his well he yeah then oh i can't give away the end so
i think so yeah she he represents her childhood he represents that part of her that that moment in time when she and her sister were pure
and he's in nostalgia for her and and he also the fact that she created something good and funny and silly and uh sweet i think is such
a a pertinent moment in the film when she she's reminded that she's capable of
it was safe to help her sister and the land that she's from and and it's like action
i have many favorite moments yeah i mean i've i love singing let it go i i i think it's such a transformative moment
character and i enjoyed the process of learning it and recording it and what it represents to the film and um i also love the song about summer that olaf sings um i love
they're a great team you know chris has been around in this industry for a long time
has the is the constant and understands how all the technicalities work and and then jennifer comes in with her thing written and
um really speaking to the soul of these characters and um they bounce off each other really well and um john lasseter would come in every once in a while he was there for the recording of let it go and that was a lot of fun it's it's one of the most collaborative processes i've ever been a part of and i love it so much
ago and put your voice to a couple of drawings and then a couple months later it's more animated and you see that they were inspired by something that
her hands are her she wears gloves all the time to hold in her powers okay so that affects the way i physically stand and move and then that informs my performance and then the songs come in the music
sweetness anyway it's just a i love it and i'm fascinated with the whole animation process so i begged them to let me come back behind
um before dorothy gets there is it actually starts
amazing beautiful sets and costumes and all of the you know the bells and whistles that a lot of people come to see
and joe mantello and and the rest of the creative staff really found a great way of of of taking this huge theater
sort of opens it up and embraces the audience and and and they just they the show starts in such a high point and it they're they're so warm already and so loving of us because of her that we just we we have we uh uh it just it her it makes our job
well not to downplay me i mean i'm i would love that's a compliment to me but i also think um
that that what they grew up seeing in the movie and and thinking of this horrible woman that they're gonna
um you it could be about a racial thing it could be about a handicap it could be it's just um it's the way people treat people that they're not
too that feel threatening to them in some way and i think that it it makes everyone think about
norbert our first love who um originated the role and it was just
insinuate he insinuates that um fiyero was the man of that was
uh more tribal and and stuff like that yeah so it it was interesting cause it makes them it makes really brings out that that racist um that racism element
she just wants to escape or wants something new wants something fresh and actually this family moved in next door to her and uh she starts
sort of me ryan and rhee had worked very closely in working on her and um you know it just became
you know it wasn't an easy process but it certainly when we got there and would start shooting it it was just so exciting and
for me it's the sort of film i wanted to watch when i was a kid so it's a real honor to be involved in something like
you know you've just got uh yeah uh uh william payne he's gonna be huge i think he's just amazing he looks amazing he sounds amazing he is amazing um
you know and and my dad which is great you know for him to kind of step on it's a real honor to see my dad in my own project it was really flattering and just felt quite
yes of course i was kind of blown away at first i was a bit like wow this is gonna be great and
you know i couldn't think for of anybody else to play butcher bryn as as better than him and and as more character it was just
much into my x files and i always loved poirot since i was a kid so to do someone
constantly making things up cause she's kinda bored and she's kinda stoned so for me it's all
um it's very exciting when actually she meets the gammons and finds like her real detective instincts kick in and you know she becomes a very good at what she's
um well i've i've just done the third series of mad dogs hence the shaved head i'm not having a meltdown
i mean who knows i'm reading something at the moment that i'm i'm very fond of but you never know what you're gonna be
and i kind of heard about the strike but um i didn't know the extent of what these women went to and that they actually went on to change the equal pay act for me that was a
i don't know it was just um really inspirational and um powerful so when i read the script i was pretty blown away and pretty
you can't quite believe it to be honest and you know to see what they're actually doing in them conditions and then they're labeled as unskilled workers
i worked for a makeup company that wasn't that bad um i don't know i've been pretty lucky with my jobs to be honest
you know i haven't been and worked in conditions like that that's for sure like these women did um you know we got a kind of feel of what they went through
when it came to kind of squashed conditions filming conditions and three hundred supporting actors
you know being squashed into a room and it being quite hectic got a little bit of a taste but um you know the they were doing some pretty hard core
yeah i mean i'm i can imagine that he was you know if people like nicola duffett and uh lorraine stanley and and me in the in the same room
she's such an amazing actress and so it's such a i know i just find her so beautiful to watch and she
um i'm i'm guessing she was you know when you look at the old footage um there was a lot of younger kind of younger girls in the in the pack but um
there was a girl that actually did a photoshoot i think and did write equal pay on her stomach
um so i think it was loosely based on her but um you know i don't know if there was a model in the group i think there was she was just a nice character and you know sandra was someone you read and you kinda go oh i
a bunch of women in their uh in the sixties worked for for
that they're labeled as unskilled workers and decide to go on strike and
into what they've got theirselves into to the political debate basically about women on
unknown uh dark waters should it be said and they end up going to the house of parliament protesting and uh end up talking to barbara castle
quite an emotional journey you watch them go through i'm sandra i play a young factory girl who um is you know aspires to be a model
no it wasn't really um i know about dagmar motors and
the whole factory um i didn't know that these women went on strike and it i didn't realize that it was the first
i didn't realize that they changed the equal pay act either so i was pretty blown away when i first read the script and discovered
to following the bright lights of london and becoming a model and uh you know doing what her heart believes is you know sticking with her friends and um you know you know protesting is something that she
no it wasn't really um i never got the motives and
um yeah i did you know you cause you kinda wanna know if you know did this really happen are these women for real
these women although they did something pretty amazing and pretty important they were kind of blissfully unaware of what they
you know although this is you know an important part of our history and and quite educational in that sense um it is still a movie and it is still
um yeah cause of the relevance i guess it will empower people um i don't know
uh you know i've my best friend's an activist and works for a charity and um you know i uh i really
you know it's uh it's quite an important cause you know the equality of pay
in that sense um so yeah hopefully it would inspire people
i think that's my version of feminist i think my mum and dad built me up to be like kind of a a strong minded woman
stuff that i've been happy with and then there's been stuff that i had had better
that are just not my taste and one in particular that was mercifully cancelled after after one season
work and and i thought it was gonna be better than it was but it was um
on the person i mean uh uh you do wanna work um especially there's if if i had children i'd be even more desirous of working in uh i don't have any kids that i am aware of i may find out twenty years from now that i
um but you know drinking does take the edge off if you do have kids i i can understand why
shooting they look at what you look like they do makeup they do your hair a certain way
this is not as bad anymore but these issues with authority perceived or
i'm not that immature anymore although i do have uh uh issues with authority figures still but i
wanted since i was uh in high school to be a stand up comic i am a stand up
is not up to me and uh that i need others to say i'm okay to do stuff no i don't
and i have been fired uh from pilots that have been re shot without me uh it's quite it's not unusual i'm not saying
myself unfortunately um about it and try and talk myself through it and a lot of times when i'm walking the dogs and i'll wind up speaking out loud on the street and then i have to start singing to
it hurts my feelings terribly cause i i want to be accepted i i want to be uh thought of for roles
well i don't know what that means on my terms i want to be accepted in that cause when i audition for things i'm not i'm not gonna be me now granted
i uh it wasn't me um uh not i'm not that i'm ashamed of it it's just that poor woman who was daria
around one it's just lovely and and then i'm sure they'll be on broadway with sebastian bach
ninety one through ninety four approximately mtv kind of had a wider wider swath if you will of the music they they uh put in rotation it was more like m two although m two is the old bait and switch they
just that i would never you know had i known him too was gonna do that to me uh i feel i was tricked by him too
and narrow the base again and and usher in this era of quote unquote pop music backstreet boys nsync all
if perpetuated by the the the wisdom of viacom or whoever the corporation that owns mtv that
kids don't wanna hear other kinds of music they're pretending that there's not a market out there if you if
that there's lower ratings they'll say uh people the people buying backstreet albums were tired of of listening to nirvana now first of all the average back street
i do i think that people should be upset about it it affects uh and like the the grammys and the mtv awards and the billboard awards
but you should also be upset if you are a listener who's not being treated with respect it is disrespectful to
great if people had that kind of like intellectual curiosity to go you know what i feel there's yo la tengo is out there i mean i'm listening to aguilera but i have a feeling that that i have a feeling that uh there's uh the hives and aimee mann and the strokes and all of these things i just know in my tiny brain that they're out
and show her the error of her thinking i would try and show her that what she does is also complicit in the dumbing down of america i have i have zero respect for what she does she she criticizes the physical appearance of people who are trying to enjoy their oscar ceremony
like people that are there to be awarded for the work that they've done she has the nerve to sit there with her daughter and that other lady
thing today on the news they keep talking about how such a groundswell of support and they're saying twenty million viewers have tuned into this but what they don't tell you is like nineteen point five million of those tune in to mock it you know i mean like you you watch it to mock it you don't watch it like oh i really love this kind
about how you know eminem did sully the atmosphere i felt at at the vmas he's a little bit hostile but then you've got justin from american
you must and they're so they're so award shows are so compellingly awful that you that you must watch them and and like i think like the grammys and the vmas they should just change the title to hooray for mediocrity you know what i mean like a celebration of
he he has taken the the torch from corey feldman has just started the idolatry of michael jackson and he just scratched the surface and then justin has picked up
why break away to do that at least when he was with them they could all shoulder the blame yeah i mean they could he could have at least claimed well they make me do this i don't have to do this and then of course he breaks away solo and it's even worse actually than it was
once said in lieu of creativity there is an undue emphasis on
and in fact i think mtv it's it's so ridiculous the way they do that now that i think for all the
this that whatever that was going on in that pseudo hip hop world and like guys with their shirts open and the wind
the mtv awards also so that after you watch the show you just go wow i almost saw everyone's vagina
that's so low that if they were any lower they'd be folded up in the drawer
timberlake and aguilera both do it like um chrissie i'm here to announce the
catch my breath um ooh you know and i and i like what did you guys come up the hard way through the new
could have done that but she wouldn't have been anywhere near as good a politician i mean elizabeth was without a shadow of a doubt one of the great
our country has ever had she was extra ordinary and how she managed to as a
you know her reign without ever getting married and having an heir and was in this you know extraordinary patriarchal society it was extraordinary and
banned in scotland who were incredibly clever incredibly charismatic and she took them on and she was
intellectually she fought them and she was really really good and for six years and by the time it all went all horribly wrong when her husband was assassinated up until that moment there it was really touch and go between her and elizabeth but you know and
i think well uh when donley was assassinated a um which in
put all of those men on trial every single one of them you must stand up and be
she was she was more impulsive and more impetuous in certain ways and i think had she sat back and gone oh okay this could completely ruin me i have to really really manage this really well and she
in line to the throne great great match excellent match the fact that he turned
uh the the the the one mistake that she made was was marrying bothwell who was absolutely implicated in in her after that
uh uh you just uh the the great thing about it is that you get to go and you get to go to all these
sat around at great length because when we first did this play we did it at a donmar which is this
they're just not iconic enough in modern dress and then i thought well we we can afford two
uh that came about because we were sitting uh actually and i had come here to see um mamma mia
when you're as good a politician i mean elizabeth was without a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest
our country has ever had she's extraordinary and how she managed to as a
you know her reign without ever getting married and having an heir was in the this you know extraordinary patriarchal society was extraordinary and she managed
so when she first came to scotland at the age of nineteen she was already widowed um
the severe the extreme protestants john knox and his band in scotland who were incredibly clever incredibly
intellectually she fought them and she was really really good and for six years and by the time it all went horribly wrong when her husband was assassinated up until that moment they it was really touch and go between her and
i think well when darnley was assassinated a um which in
elizabeth wrote mary a letter saying you must put all of those men on trial every single one of them you must stand up and be innocent and shoot them down in flames she didn't take her advice she
with us but i think she she wasn't she was she was more impulsive and more impetuous in certain ways and i think had she sat back and gone oh okay this could completely ruin me i have to really really manage this really well and she
uh uh the the the one mistake that she made was was marrying bothwell who was absolutely implicated in in her after that you know everyone goes on about mary but you know she was in prison for nine
don't take this in the wrong way one has to care very little about it about any outcome you just have to go
we sat around at great length because when we first did this play we did it at the donmar which is a studio about the size of this table and uh we had about seventy five pence
good idea um and we thought about doing it um in you know all of us in modern dress that just didn't work cause these women just they're just not iconic enough in modern dress so then i thought well okay well we we can afford two
allows albert to be um to be more himself he allows the person to allow
as a wife she's incredibly happy um she is herself she's more happy as hubert than she ever would be as her
other female self i don't know what that name ever was we never find out
avoiding any kind of uh relationship whatsoever and feels his life
is more um less damaged i think or more resilient perhaps who has suffered from you know in her past and who then lives her life as a
and then finds that she's happiest as a man and then meets her wife his his wife her wife and um they fall madly in love and they're very happy together so that's fine she's just who she is and she accepts that and that's what's and that's the big thing she's the one character for albert who just says well i am what i am and that's just
in this in this room hubert accidently realizes that albert is a woman
you know i don't believe that in all the bars in all the world i end up in this one in another room with a a guy dressed as a a woman dressed as a man that's just very funny i think she thinks it's incredibly ironic and rather funny and you know she has her own
just she's phenomenal she's absolutely fantastic she's she's one of those people who um because she
patty hewes and because she's mm been in several films where she's been oh i don't know the president or whatever but i think people are often quite frightened of her cause they think she's quite tough and all of that and she's uh a huge perfectionist don't get me wrong but she is such fun and she's so warm
uh and she's incredibly professional which i really admire as well as all of her other artistic qualities she's great we we've become really good mates i think she's fantastic
big hearted very clever sexy lovely
the twist on a take or you know and when i was in new york before i shot this i would
doing everything for her son and her love for her son and for the opportunity to live in a world with him
and she'll have a voice and be able to protect him and that is only possible if she continues with her path of being
but she's definitely gone out on her own uh she doesn't trust the exit switches anymore and
derive as the countess someone who is a much older wiser witch who could kill mary in a heartbeat
like like any mother if you think that something is wrong with your child you probably go through a state of denial with
lot of stuff going on but she wants to protect him she can't fully understand his
and goes on and the relationship develops it becomes more and more difficult to ignore the facts that he is not
is is evil just evil cause otherwise how can you how can you sympathize with your character no one believes that they are evil but they're actually
people much like a politician can send people to war and be like you know we lost a hundred people or whatever but
don't like to see people suffer and she's always she's sort of a robin hood like fighting for the the downtrodden like isaac cause that's where she came from so i think
she's definitely not like all good let's be honest but what's so great about the character and the way she's written is
try and get equal pay for women uh she would definitely you know because i feel like that's a lot of what mary's fighting for is for a voice in society to be treated equally um so in modern day society i think it would be very much like she'd be
five episodes of the show but i just loved him so much and he really challenged me as an actor and
so yeah anything with him um what else that i really love
they'll be connected with mary and wanna watch her so i guess it's different in that sense in
no one to turn to it's like it's all bubbling up inside of her like right here and i film
you can't just switch it off otherwise it wouldn't be real for the cameras so it does kind of cause you like
really smart writing um that's what i found and and dynamic characters and you know each with their
and kind of potential to move forward so i felt like even if there was you know like anne hale in the first episode i was intrigued what would happen with her what would happen with john and mary and cotton and none of the characters were black and white so i wasn't sure who i was meant to to trust
uh were real um it wasn't just hysteria and take that as you will um i just uh i mean from from the work that i've done and from growing up in england that there would the history of of
that whatever you believe a witch to be i mean in puritan society anyone that was
different or or women that spoke up to a man or had a different opinion from a man they were a witch so whether they were casting spells
taking the metaphor almost of like what a witch is and putting them in control um is
yeah a little bit of it yeah i think what's interesting about the writing is that we we've gone back in certain episodes and given
of things to the audience but hopefully because it's seven years we can continue to do
all combined it's just the story uh it's not one you can't take just one element of the story i think you know the the location that we're shooting at
the the performances that people are giving i think are are pretty
uh she is like family to mary you know they're they're witches
and rightfully so and i also think that tituba doesn't really trust mary but
do protect each other and they they have a complicated relationship and i
mary in so many ways but mary doesn't treat her particularly well so
the stuff that we've had this season is it feels like one moment we're sort of having a breakthrough and maybe we're gonna repair our relationship and then like snap at each other again and so we
you find out as the season goes on she's actually incredibly powerful and if she learns to
who is a much a much older wiser witch and could kill mary just like that
a blood witch she came into witchcraft much later she doesn't know the history of witchcraft but she obviously has something special because she's managed to
like obviously can't happen in front of the the puritans but as we know like mary is very good at manipulating
also she has she has another battle going on there's a new puritan character he's so evil he just talks to women
and they grin and bear each other but you feel like
and i think for her it's all about like protecting her son creating a world in which she can have her son without you know being frowned upon by the puritan society or
back back up again and so she's gonna be you know extra nasty to
size zero because i was valentino's muse i was versace's muse as a
along with that strive and need to be perfect it was also the to keep it that way and it was a
say have children first like i did i was thirty two when i first got my first set of false
surgery my second was what was it botox i got the botox because i had all these
you know but it's like okay yes i had nathan and for the first time in my life my son nathan he nineteen years
and all when i when i walk through a a restaurant people were staring at my chest i thought i had ketchup on my chest
who added the fault the smallest false implants alive i said make them really small make them
one girl meets the other girl and they make out so you spend an entire hour watching two girls make out it's like where is the modeling
rock stars that i've dated you have surgeons you name it i need an accounting firm to add up all the men that i've dated well i'm nine hundred
names but there are countless young girls that i want to give personal shout out and thanks back to with with fan letters that just have said thank you for writing the truth about an industry that
absolutely when i was modeling back in the day and still i just did a fashion show yesterday there tyra banks is the last of the great breed of super
tyra turns them out on the show but like that's not quite enough for the industry where there's like so
when you're a young girl and you're an you're when you're a young girl and you're impressionable you think i need to feed my ego with a list guys because
their career and that that means i i should be like dating them cause it would be good for my career according to my
of their career and that that means i i should be like dating them because it would be good for my career according to my agent
stallone jack nicholson warren beatty liam neeson you know just to name a
thought it was a good idea for me to date someone of another caliber let me tell you something you guys i it it just fed into my
model they they wanted the supermodel who was on the cover of cosmopolitan and vogue they didn't want they did not know what want to know what was on the inside
for the seventy five pounds of hair there's fourteen inches of makeup you know it's not that
say no to drugs and alcohol i would have to say stay in school
or the photographer that you go to work with is credible because a lot of times these scams out there they will hire the girl and sometimes the girls don't come back to work they end up being kidnapped and and
turning tricks out in some other city or in mexico or they don't even know where they end up that
credulous people that are that are posing as model agents and photographers just because you answer some ads in the paper number four always have an adult accompany
that loves and wants to protect you mandatory cause you don't know where you're gonna end up number six seven eight make sure that someone knows where you are at all times you know like this girl that ended up in the caribbean
get janice and and spencer and heidi did try to get me and i took spencer's
and you know i i'd been on it for quite a while so you know and along with menopause and
i was asking for the medication for a reason i i travel back and forth to london i i went nine times to london like
and you have to be up really early to do those shows around christmas time so i've been taking them but i didn't like
to stop everything and what happened to me in my case was
shakes my hands were shaking i had no idea what was happening to me and they were
gone okay we're gone we're on sobriety let's surround
environmental it's peer pressure and it's but it's also her parents throwing her when she wasn't
plying them with drugs and alcohol on a constant basis that's why that's why it's really hard for me no it's not hard for me i'm here to say to
i wrote three books no lifeguard on duty which is a cautionary tale of incest sex drugs rock and roll studio fifty four fashion and thrival
in my case i was hired to be a role model and here i was stumbling down stairs you know and just screaming and calling calling the girls whores it was a it was bad and i and i and i still apologized
i was promised greatness on that show if i stayed five seasons and you know as in every case with every uh show they wants to take it and have a different twist okay i got fired
and uh you know i just you know uh you know with everything that's going on i haven't been able to breathe like the whole nation is doing right now protesting i am protesting because of the the the unresolved issues due to rape from bill
starting to exhale and and i will say this i you know
not just for me for what's going on with these other
i'm in huge gratitude to the los angeles police department you know thank you guys and gals out there you know it's about
i know that i am an american and i know that this country was based on two premises freedom of speech and the right to bear arms okay and it was the right thing for me to do when
woman out there to please hear my words we've gotta stop this man he will keep doing it
in bali indonesia i was contacted by cosby
saying that he had heard that i was there working he wanted
from from bali he wanted me to stop my job working for a calendar
he then asked me to get to bali i said i can't afford to get to bali he said well i'll get you an economy ticket i said i don't fly economy that's like a long way to go he
i arrived in in reno i also inform him on the telephone
he told me that i was going to get a job on the cosby show that i was going
to me about you know putting me on the cosby show and he also told me you know i i heard you were singing you want a singing career because he knew prior to that that i had been in rehab in nineteen eighty two you know
had heard because he contacted me in rehab then you know sent me a couple dozen red roses this married pig and he told me that he wanted
st mary's in minneapolis in the middle of winter this you know how did he how did he even know that i was there it's supposed to be an anonymous rehab why are they putting this pig on the
i have to say about that first of all i thought you know americans have a right to you know freedom of speech and when the presiding officer you know banged his gavel and said we have rules i mean i thought the whole just just the to watch the house at work
document the united constitution so whether someone said something about obama right today was inconsequential this is about the united states constitution
conscience and it's time to bring it back and and it was a symbolic sort of representation that the voice of america was heard and you know in twenty ten
i absolutely respect it the american people gathered together to say look we're not happy with the direction of this the way the country's going and we want it brought back to the
and the fact that they read the constitution just shows that they're bringing us back to america's principles and they listened
well i i think it's it's a pause it's a patriot's pause to really stop to think about alright
and i'd much rather have that then someone just disregarding the constitution or not acknowledging the constitution and just throwing something in the hopper and and having it voted upon when it's it has no bearing and and no
law that has given the government such a broad scope over the states and the american people all these government you know these
full of them were are out out out of bounds of the constitution most of them and healthcare
looking at the document and then debating it that's better than having no
find out what's in it i mean oops we didn't know that was in the healthcare
and i have all i'm just actually today i feel happy that at
say things or don't say things to me it's just a great day that we have an that look
you know the transition of speaker to speaker from president to president that our document is still at work that it was read today on the house floor i just think
bureau stated that forty three percent of mothers in america were
tribute of abigail adams to the women who are back at home while their husbands are in
raising her children and and even uh women that are married with children are relating to the book because the women are just such for mothers and so i thought how can we all be inspired and god led me to these amazing twelve women that on a on a day where i'm feeling a little bit down i i read
to helena augusta but they all had great faith and i i read about other women as well
blame inside and they all had these sort of terrible situations that they went through devastating times and they didn't allow they had to make a choice and they were devastated and some of them just didn't want to go on they wanted just to run away from it and go become a nun and leave their

thousand three us census bureau stated that forty three percent of mothers in america were single
tribute of abigail adams to the women who are back at home while their husbands are in
raising her children and and even uh women that are married with children are relating to the book because the women are just such foremothers and so i thought how can we all be inspired and god led me to these amazing twelve women that on a on a day where i'm feeling a little bit down i i read their
i i thought this is and then i realized wait a minute look they've been doing it for centuries and i was able to go all the way back to the third century to helena augusta but they all had great faith and i i read about other women as
fact that they all had a flame inside that i believe god gives us a flame inside and they all had these sort of terrible situations that they went through devastating times and they didn't allow they had to make a choice and they were devastated and some of them just didn't want to go on they wanted just to run away from go become a nun and leave their

claire brown looked for her child who was sold from her on the auction block for over thirty
a great attitude and christine de pisan lost everything all of her
and she uh lost everything all of her furniture was taken from her but she she just became this first female professional writer and just wrote that women weren't being treated correctly and how could she help the women

and never once thought that her child was going to suffer because she was
realize that okay god's given me a purpose i can live that purpose and my
enjoy reaching out and speaking with with single mothers across the country i just met with some women at the
at centers so that's really where my heart is it's it's it's interesting because as an actress and
when when god's given me the the the opportunity through my publishers which i really appreciate to write then maybe i can go and help others and be a service like these
characters um and that's that all that it comes down to really i think the fact that it takes place
and things from that time and that makes it that adds another uh layer but i think it comes down to
he's there on set looking at each little piece of fruit i mean he is he is mad men and without him um there would be no mad men so
just the process of doing a television show where we you
to sixty pages in very short amount of time it's been sort of an acting school of just uh memorization and learning things and going basically on instinct and not having a lot of rehearsal time and um at all so um
securities that that i mean i've kind of grown into being a woman in the nine years or so that we've been doing this so i mean i've learned a lot about myself
well i just think that quality of tv has grown so much and i think mad men was part of that movement in the
some of the best writing that's happening in general in movies and tv is happening on cable television and uh i think
they're not many many many episodes i think that because they're cut down into ten
but uh there's just so many wonderful writers and directors and actors that are doing tv because there's so many more chances being taken in
deep and um i have very little time to watch tv so it's usually the half hour programs or just reality tv that i don't have to pay much
you know played all you know all over the world is is really incredible and and surprising to me too cause i wasn't sure
and it was heartbreaking to read it when we first got the scripts and then to play them out and for john and i
you know this marriage and this partnership as as actors and coworkers was ending it was very
i got used to this very dysfunctional don and betty you know even though that they were obviously unhappy with one another that that it would actually end was um
living in the same house with the children and a new baby just a different
thing to walk into it has a very strange feeling and i think it's supposed to it's supposed to be
there's just this replacement man who's what she wanted don to be all along but she just kinda filled that space for him so
story line for my character in season four is her struggling
thing that she has oh she has kids with this other guy and
and don and her's relationship is frayed but it's still trying to you know trying to be civil but not really there's
and the you know what must happen to a lot of married and divorced couples so um it's just her trying to find
her um relationship with the kids especially with sally is very strained and very volatile
of course she's changed a lot i think that she's um she speaks her mind a lot more she's uh she has an idea of what she wants um she
you know married to another man she's lost all her parents she's basically been orphaned she's had to you know accept all these different scenarios
we start shooting episode eleven tomorrow and i got the script last night so it's not only just an excitement to see what happens but it's a bit of panic
of the scripts are so they're so brilliantly written in such a short period of time and the
um how they put it together it's it's i mean they really really really deserve
maybe do don't relate to her as a person or don't sometimes understand
that she does and moves that she makes i'm very defensive of her when someone else talks about her
you know been able to continue to grow as a as a person and she's trying she might not be
many of so many of us individually on the show and everyone involved in making the show recognize
a couple times and then matt wrote a couple scenes for me to read for betty because she wasn't a character yet or she
um since the very beginning because after i auditioned for
i kinda put it out of my mind and um was doing other
and like a year later we found out it was picked up and we were going to start shooting so there's just been a lot of
time in between in between seasons there's a lot of time and um now there's this whole other gap in between the first seven and the last seven of the final
feels like a very short amount of time but also very drawn out amount of time where i almost can't even remember what my life was like before um but it was
um the sets were amazing i mean uh i've spent most of my time either on location
uh or um on stage inside a draper or francis home um
the people that are involved in the show are very detailed to the point where they don't even need
part of the pass back that people like to revisit um and then in visually it's exciting and
nostalgic for certain people and the fashion is fun and the way people behave seems sort of fun but the reason why it's such a hit with fans
the writing and how these characters are written and how they're flushed out and how they're very real people they're not just
they might not like it they might see something of themselves in these characters and then have a negative response to it but i think that's because
and it's the fact that it is a sci fi show that's not really a sci fi show um i think that eh that's the world that it's
about people who love each other and want to be happy inside a spot it's like
to see how well we've been able to integrate you know uh the
technology and and um and corporations and and medicine and how that's affecting our lives and also how it affects our
but it'd been on network tv it's like such a perfect setup for for new people who don't really watch sci fi shows to be involved
to get to finish telling your story and nobody has to keep fighting and nobody has to come back to work on monday and wait to find out like what the numbers were for friday
thing ever like all we get to do is have fun and we get to tell a really good story because that's the priority you know it's not like i said it's not about numbers it's not about money
cause i totally forgot what it was that's what i mean i think that she um uh uh that's his way of of showing affection for her i don't
in the middle of the night and like tries to stuff candy down your throat like that's the only way that he knows how to show that love and i think with astrid it's with you know
like a last minute decision so i don't think she said that i don't know
in her family that she cares about and so i think it would be a big oversight to just leave that blank and i want
emotional discourse about what about my dad you know he's not around anymore and that's so pivotal
you know like what happens to your family what happens to you when they're not around anymore so i hope for astrid's story that that is
stuff um but with with the singing i had i had no
especially in this in this world and i think that it worked out surprisingly well like it made it made sense that you know it wasn't
wasn't here last year and and we were talking about how when uh the three main actors josh and john and anna came and
it was it was a different kind of vibe cause everyone knew it was gigi abrahams but they didn't really know what it was about and now
yeah you know it's funny it's it's harder in different ways because we had to transition from new york to vancouver so in some ways it was like starting over again
was like you know a cow on the high fashion diet or something and her moo is so weird that they're probably gonna have to dub in moos
have the stage presence that our new york cow had but i have high
that she will be able to to fit into her role a little bit more
writers and of course they were extremely vague about telling me what was going to happen because they don't wanna give up too much information but they said that she's going to get out of the lab and that they had some exciting things
that was uh the first scene i think where the audience gets to see
the crazy guy it's you know a little bit more intimate and a little bit sweeter so
season two is already starting off to be we've shot uh three episodes and i read the fourth
and then just stick with it the same way they they changed it up immediately so i think that that's going to keep the viewers that we already have and probably attract more
because they loved the show that much and talking about how a big part of being on a television show is trying to get
because they live in a reality that has never been seen in a show before so it's almost like starting from scratch like you're being
so he's being integrated again so it's almost like uh like this is the perfect
you would need to probably go back to really get the story of who
exist does that mean that without memory of them that they
energy somewhere and people just don't have him in their minds i
snippet of information that uh that might entice viewers who
is to think of the michael jackson song man in the mirror and that's going to that's like a tiny tiny
to let you know that peter's gone but he's not all the way
song and it might it might symbolize something important in this first episode for people who are really
environment that the audience has never seen before because of course peter peter's not here peter doesn't exist we've never
still two worlds and if you remember the the finale of season three uh where the big machine is that's kind of the space
same space together uh without disrupting anything and so you find out that this world our world is working with
through that room where the machine is that's bringing them together to try and figure out how they can repair their universe so they're having to like review each other's case
each other and we were like it's like if it's just yesterday like there was no
to slide right back into it it was like butter that part was really cool i wasn't expecting that and i don't think that
this show is about a comet that is about to hit the earth and end all life as we
there are a bunch of different characters all dealing with this impending end of the world and we all have a different goal different something that we're trying to accomplish before the world end
i play a character named rhonda she is a librarian she's a mom she's just an ordinary woman
i'm in prison in new mexico my family is in washington dc and i bust out of prison and i now have to make it across the united states and get home but so that i can see my family before the world
megan mullally in the show is completely unrecognizable in the most delicious way possible megan plays a career criminal a white supremacist who is in jail and takes sort of a liking to my
i don't know why she does but she does help me out and as i'm busting out of prison she literally shackles herself to my ankle and forces herself
i think it's really fun to follow a lot of different people's storylines um everyone's story is quite different um
i really like the international scope of the show i really like it's really beautiful to look at um it's not the same network but if you love amazing race or house hunters
love this show just because you get a peek at all these different worlds um we shot the show in south africa in london in malta the locations are so beautiful and um i think it just almost looks like something that you don't normally see on television you sort of see this kinda stuff in the movies but i don't think you see it on
this show is one hundred percent different from anything you've ever seen before
completely it's i feel like people say that all the time and people even say i feel like you hear that all the time all the time but this
i hear a lot of feedback from fans who just sort of um maybe fell in love around the
oven now they've gotten married and they're starting families so i think there is like sort of a
community like a generational thing where people are kinda doing this at the same time
cause if she checks in after midnight she gets a whole extra day paid
well in this episode pam is having contractions at work but she doesn't
but she's refusing and then they get the office to kind of distract her from her
i think it's kinda cool because jim and pam are usually the two reasonable people in the office but now this baby and the contractions
my sister just had a baby two days ago and so through my whole fake pregnancy
experiencing a real pregnancy so i've been calling her and asking her advice on how to act like a real pregnant woman and um she just gave birth so i was even able to call her and say um it was really cute i texted her and i said okay i'm they're saying that my contractions are six minutes apart how much pain am i in and she texted back you're uncomfortable but not
yeah he sorta treats pam like um he sorta takes on kind of a fatherly role but also sometimes crosses the line into doing things that the husband should be doing so he rides that
but um but like i said in this episode pam is all for spending time with michael because she's trying to distract herself from her labor and he is um actually
funny because i never set out to be particularly a comedic actress my background i was i studied theater and um when i came out to hollywood and i was making my way i just tend to get cast comedically and i think i have that sensibility but i tend to approach the work from like that theater actress place of making everything really
like i never took improv classes or sketch comedy classes and i can't do um characters i can't really invent characters so i think that the characters that i do they're always coming
talked to peter and bobby about it and um it was really important to them that um when this woman gives her husband the hall pass that she doesn't seem crazy that she seems like she's made a really thoughtful
rational decision she's at the end of her rope and um luckily owen and i really hit it off right away he
is such a good hearted warm person that we were able to connect quickly and i think that shows in the movie and um
so it was important it was important that you felt like this was a real woman who was really grasping to save her marriage and um because without it you weren't really rooting for the guys you know you wanted to really you wanted them to have fun on
was really hard to shoot where they're walking around and they're on the hidden cameras and they don't know it it's um we were laughing it was hard to keep a straight face when you saw everything they were doing and some of it was scripted but sometimes they would ad lib and so we would kinda lose it and we'd have to try to get it back but um so yeah that wasn't that
think you need to get away from the restaurants and get into places like target
place where there will be way more women than men and women are not expecting a
should the wrapping paper aisle or maybe like the scrapbooking aisle because those aisles
gonna think that you're like you know out working but that's a good thing you're like you're just heading to the garden
i like i had to put the the facebook live down um but you're all very important
thanks guys for the nice comments always very sweet always really uh honestly i really like seeing you guys all say nice things cause it's nice to hear nice things about yourself and to feel loved and that's what i feel when i
different but i hope that you know like i'm trying to be sincere and not just say like oh i'm like fans yeah you guys are great
watching this or supporting whatever it's nice and just that's know that that's how i
if i what do i wish if i could change the world oh god a number of things
i saw somebody's comment that was interesting oh who do i look up to more as an artist literally the guy that i was playing earlier whose name uh is jon bellion or i don't know how you say his last name
i love him as an artist and think that he's really hit the nail on the head and he's doing some really
i respect anybody as an artist who's trying to push things forward and that you know or succeeding in pushing things forward
your point of view up on its head and make you say oh well maybe i didn't see that way before and open your mind a little bit i'm super into that
going through the process for a long time uh definitely drew on my patience
don't think i've i've definitely been made that uncomfortable before i should take that back but it was like a different level of discomfort um there were like rats biting my toes and the
near i was taking like the workout class and i ran into him out front of a rite aid near that workout class a couple months afterward and we like took a picture
no uh what about my soul i don't know it's there it's alive it's kicking
lkke weird like the monthly kinda check ins with myself to be like yeah what have i done this month where have i spent most of my time and last month one of the things that i realized is that i went to the
so i was like maybe moving forward uh into november i need to cut back on the del taco
i know that's probably disgusting to some of you health nuts um and honestly i try to be healthy sometimes but it's just
um my favorite fast food burger is is a probably a whopper that's coming to mind or in n out i actually haven't had a whopper in forever i've had in n out more
um what musical would you like to do i don't know if i would
frozen musical come on of course uh and i would wanna be olaf in case you were wondering if you could be any kitchen appliance what would you be and why
let me think if i've dated guys with tattoos i think i've dated a few guys with tattoos maybe not though
canada and i think it's awesome i think the people are you know as nice as you would expect the restaurant
um it is really difficult i actually shot a show in toronto though in the dead of winter and that was difficult because it was so
yourself and knowing the things that you want in your life and the things that are important to you knowing what you want to give your
attention to and what you don't and deciding that for yourself and not
i have been snowboarding i fractured my wrist haven't been skiing want to go
winter or summer i'm gonna go winter i love christmas i'm a winter girl i'm pretty excited by the even the weather shift a little bit uh here in la i know it's not much especially for you know those of you who are used to the snow and everything like that but it's
puerto rico or hawaii oh i've been to hawaii i feel like i might've been to puerto
um that's a question that my friend mia
oh fan of the fan of the horror genre i don't know i like it some i
like a huge fan i've seen some really good horror movies but i'm not just like naturally i don't naturally gravitate
uh guest starred on icarly and that came about because we found out that she actually likes the show a lot and um we we were all at some like the saturday night live after party and she was there and our producer started talking to her and they were both chatting it up and she
i mean it's really surprising we've had some really really big guest stars and they're really when i say like they couldn't have been nicer i literally i'm not just throwing that around even though it sounds like i am these two
um i loved i guess in the victorius is this crazy like psycho girl named ponnie i would love to return as ponnie because i really had a lot of fun
he wears those cute little suspenders and he's adorable um but zane was really really sweet
let me tell you i seen that stuff twice and that is amazing i love it oh my goodness
birds eye vegetables to inspire a whole new generation of vegetable lovers and to encourage kids to see their veggies as
who produced uh icarly victorious a number of really um great nickelodeon shows he is producing my show and i'm very excited to be in his hands because
bands in charge good um and we're taping the pilot in a few
done with this album i i'm a big fan of being completely honest so i actually left capitol national recently um i think i would love
my life it wound up being i don't know but i would love to pursue other deals and um
i've really found that i love a lot of the top forty stuff and i just um i love songs that are catchy and that are just fun to sing and that make you feel great and that you just wanna like roll your windows down and just blast it and it can never be too loud and
i love miss miranda cosgrove's dancing crazy and disgusting i could listen to those things i probably have listened to those things fifteen hundred times like everybody who knows me is just tired of those songs because i overplay them so much um so i would love to do
and uh and say now and i think that's a thing nowadays everything's becoming more and more and more fan powered and it's great to have these social networking platforms because you can get that immediate feedback from the
fans so you don't have to do any guesswork yourself you can just say hey guys what do you think about this so it's great to have that kind of a
you know they're so different i feel like whatever i'm really throwing myself into more at that time is what i'm really into and i always describe it you know as having like two kids
if a second kid comes along you're not gonna say oh i still like tommy better than susie you know hopefully i hope parents don't have favorite kids but uh that's how i always describe it cause i
um i well i always listen to music and stuff like when i'm getting ready uh that's kind of that's kinda my go to or i'll be writing to my friends or call my mom
yes um well today i'm excited to see the flatts rascal flatts oh they're so good and i saw alan jackson rehearsing yesterday and he sounded amazing um so i'm really excited to see him and i'm presenting to the band perry so i love their song if i die young so it'll be
and uh i've heard from our producer that we're gonna have some very snazzy guest stars
i can't say anything for sure because we haven't started yet so like once we've shot them then i'm allowed to say but uh but it's gonna be really fun i can't wait
um no actually i i one of my friends had a skateboard on set and i started using their skateboard
felt like i was using theirs too much and i was kinda being a burden like hey can i use your skateboard again so then i thought i should just get my
um new year's plans i think i'm gonna be oh you know what i'm going to park city to go skiing yeah i can't wait my family and i are
you know i feel like my album has so many different perspectives and so many different angles there's some that's really some songs that are really based
too um so i try to make my songs uplifting and and in some way uh kind of not motivational or but
of course i love outside cuts as well and songs from other people because there's so many talented writers out there but um but i'm happy to have a few songs that have been
pin down to like you know you have to be in this age range or this demographic to
i might i might just not make it i might just not make it um and i may have a little uh a little work going on with jay demarcus of rascal flatts but i'm not gonna say too much but
it i always there's like a hair and makeup person who does my hair and makeup so that's always helpful and i can just kinda sit there and talk to them and find out what's been new with their
used to like ride the subway stoned in new york and like you know when it gets dark
for college like i would listen like on repeat the amelie soundtrack and just like just imagine myself as a woman in a movie that
instant with the audience a a conversation that's evolving um not you know clubby or anything like that she wrote it we cut it down uh
we did uh some workshopping where i improvised the set based off of what she had written and uh she recorded that and rewrote
bullet points so that i was not memorized so that it could be natural and you would have the
came up during it and she would also call out to me during the shooting and
like yo circle back to talking about um dirty underwear or
and then i would go back and during that time of kind of walking backwards
that's good i mean it's in my nature to be playful and it's in my nature to
i don't know i try i tried that's all i can say for myself but um for gillian to say
who is i am like really active and kind of high energy if i was excited and felt like oh i
and the i i felt like i wanted to add i would only add if it
the the point that we had was that were thoughtfulness to film about
did film and the jokes that you know like that you're an
i was young and can't remember anything else it is my first and
desire and she was uh my age and acting when i was growing up and
a huge fan um but you know the after getting past that
just like being totally floored was discovering her personality she's very wise
and i think she sets the bar really high for performance and i felt that in a good way you know i i wanted to
never seemed right to me but i'm not donna i know my boundaries and i think um although my stand up is about like being horny and having diarrhea and things like that um i still feel that it
really you are supposed to adopts dogs and we should um but i um i found reggie on what was maybe one of the worst days of my life i was um i really wanted to be an actress i'd just graduated from college i did not know any performers or how to become an actress so i thought i should be an assistant to a performer and i went on craigslist and there was an opera singer and i was like whoa this is really
to be this man's assistance i met him in a public place he seemed fine
normal i guess um and he was like well we need help um decorating the apartment would you like to do that and i was like oh i love that i would love to help you you know
beautiful and he gave me the address he said come here it was like a fancy apartment in the west village i was like this is great um and i got
the lobby was nice the stairs were really pretty i went up the stairs um i walked in the apartment door was like open
down the beach and it's a beautiful time and then you step on a dead fish and you're like ew and then you look up and you realize it's like a red
and like i have the kind of personality where like my mom would never put my name on my shirts or like no no like jenny shirts or anything because i'm very friendly and she was afraid that like some weirdo in a van would be like jenny i'm supposed to pick you up from school today and i
this burrito i look up and the apartment is filled with garbage it's just a total crack den it was a total crack den and i was like and the dude is in there and he's like
live a life um and so there were jars of like everything in me was like jenny those are jars of pee
but uh um so and i was like well he's an opera singer maybe it's like a fancy
um so i was like we need to drink and then i looked and one was just like a smucker's jam jar with jam still in it and i was like okay
terrifying experience within the apartment uh i eventually got on my cell phone and pretended to be on a call um i should of just left
that means i could leave and then i went to a pet store to cheer myself up and look at the puppies um so i was like well
fun free that's what reggie is and he was up in the corner and i was like what's
like oh he's just not a puppy and nobody really wants him and we don't know what to do with him and i was like i took it so personally
like at at sleepaway overnight camp and i remember um putting a bunch of socks in one of our counselor's sports bras and doing like a stupid um
lip synch to a version of zip a dee doo dah that they used for the aerobics classes at camp and just thinking i was so funny and also we put it in in the butt
i would say i use the world shithead four to you know twenty times a week depending on who i've met shithead
marcel started with the voice um i was at my friend gabe's brother's wedding and we were all like crammed into one hotel room me and my husband my friend mike his husband and my friend
and i just felt crammed in with all these boys and really small
just tiny and uh my husband had promised a friend that he would do a video for her like sort of art comedy show thing that she was doing and then he forgot to do it and then like three days before he was like oh shit we need to do this so um we decided to make a little short using that voice and my husband created marcel how he looks he
it's fun it's exactly what you'd think except more i think because well there are only two marcel videos online we get to do marcel
and i'm not allowed to use the marcel voice during romantic
which is called the most surprised i've ever been um which is a lovely thing to know what that is i actually don't know what the most surprised i've ever been is um comes out on october twenty first and then i've also
finished kroll show season three and recorded more bob's
i'm gonna be on brooklyn nine nine in the fall just the season premiere and go back to parks and rec and house of lies oh and married the tv show that i'm on that it's on tv right now
season one that she's been pursuing and and wanting more than anything but obviously she made a mistake first episode back she's stolen javier's music who is no longer with us yes he
so the next few episodes is definitely chaotic she's going to fall into the whole whirlwind of fame and and essentially her career
drama is something that always follows her around she's essentially addicted to it and the highs and the lows and the chaos but the next few episodes she's definitely going to be living it up and loving the
and kind of losing uh who she is essentially and from dates with joe jonas and and red carpets and this whole whole
focused on music and i've been singing since i was three i've been singing my whole life and and played piano for ten years and i love it and it's something that a lot of people didn't know they're they uh i think they just thought oh this actress and she's trying to sing but i've really been singing my whole
uh the ironic stuff happens very ironically if you will um i was recording in london and happened to be at the same studio as him
i said sure and didn't really i wasn't really familiar with a lot of his stuff and i obviously went home did my research and was really excited and then when he called and told me it was his single i was very excited and then
and oh my gosh that's so hard i'm definitely loving the cardigan right now not in today
i love the cardigan i'm loving like the high waisted skirts i am loving the
yeah oh and i like the socks with the high heels though like i've been doing that on the show like the cute little ones like i'm liking
makes me uncomfortable um i'm pretty i'm pretty
cool with taking risks like fashion wise like i don't really i kinda like to try everything once so um yeah i guess something not
um and she's been trying to to have things go smoothly but she's also someone that gets very bored
um and she loves navid she really does but um she's ultimately torn between this new life and this new decision and her old life and the acting which is such a huge part of who she is and teddy montgomery has definitely spiced things up
he represents this childlike happiness and her childhood eh essentially and summer camp and all this
that are just passionate and fun and now more reality like schoolwork no acting um home on a
i have to see but yeah definitely tonight where she or last week where she had to make the decision between going on an audition
um she ends up lying to naveed goes on the audition books the part
i think what you saw all last year her trying to do and she already lost it once before because of the cocaine
she kisses him and realizes that it's the wrong thing
either way i love them but i love working with both actors and both are very true to the story you know cause she had very special relationships with both navid has been there for her both through thick and thin and was going to marry her when she was pregnant with somebody else's baby i mean that's dedication
uh teddy never really had to go through any of that when she was thirteen and twelve
her torn between the two guys and between like what she's done and when she's under pressure she's someone that cracks she can't handle it and she turns to other substances to like numb the
she um she does a lot of like crazy things when she's under pressure as you saw from last
i i like tried to play her off as like being just so you know like
thing about the baby is something she'll never forget that's obviously a life changing thing but as of now you've seen her hold it all together and she's wound up so tight which just makes for a greater
and other than that i don't really know i uh i got the offer
initially i thought i was being punked and i was expecting ashton kutcher to jump out of the closet even the first day of filming
to do it to do it with two of my favorite actors of all time was a dream come true
but there was a moment where i looked at him and i was like wow i am making out with alf
that's not to say there weren't moments in between takes where we weren't laughing
the hardest thing about this whole process cause secret movies are really hard and my friends would be asking me where i was going and i'm like i'm i'm filming something that i
that i respect them so much and kristen's one of my role models and i
yeah share some screen time with her was amazing and i would love to do some comedies and and yeah
me as the psychopath that um i'm i'm stealing the women's men away from
song when i was nine years old and i love it it's something that i do like when i'm not filming i am in the studio creating and writing so the last single that like came out was called silicone in stereo and i wrote it
book on and i wrote it about some of my experiences in la and it's about staying true to yourself and and not and not getting consumed by this crazy world and um
and yeah and then i've got some new music coming out this summer that i'm really really excited about so and some films out in the fall
i um i flew in this morning and my single bang bang came out
in like twelve countries at the moment yeah it's really overwhelming i haven't really it hasn't kinda sunk in
this reaction i've had especially in the us um obviously having ariana grande and nicki has super helped me out and i've i'm so thankful i meet them tomorrow for the first time
basically and max martin was like i want it to almost be like a girl band i didn't want it to be a feature i wanted it to be like us three
enough anymore and i just felt like since like moulin rouge like lady marmalade i used to love that i wanted to be
and taken out and someone else is put in so it's really boring but they have to connect the bones have to all
yes i love like in the uk like bashment um is huge there so like growing up that's all i used to go to is bashment raves like vybz kartel and popcaan like i would just go
so no one would notice uh is fine there's enough there'll be enough girls in there that would suit that
like that's what i listen to but obviously singing annie isn't the same you know um so many
producers do stuff so i feel like as time's gone on i've learnt that and realized that you kinda have to just go this is how i do things it's like if you wanna wear jordans you don't go to a crocs
be i kinda get frustrated at campaigns and stuff cause for me it's not
a moment it's a lifestyle like don't allow bullying to become moments where it's okay and then other times it's not like it's point blank it's not cool um and a majority of the time the bully
chills like glass on the stage i was like okay it's you know it's a little ghetto vibes i
being in the dark was weird um and the lights didn't come back on so they stopped my music so i'm just there singing in pitch
to get an early night i honestly like i have had so many things in my life that have happened to me that i do not take this for granted like this is my life right here so i owe it to my fans to be amazing at what i do like so i everyday i'm trying to teach myself something new and i really do dedicate my life like the way i eat the way i live
look after myself because i know that one day i could fall ill and so i make sure that i do my best to be able to do this promo schedule this ridiculous like it's crazy but everyone else does it so i wanna make
yeah no we just arrived and there was loads of fans and paparazzi and i just kind of i think i'm just i don't know
it's it's kind of in its in its growing stages and um we just saw a picture of me and i was like someone came in here last year
always i think it's healthy always be a little bit as long as it's comes from a good place you know cause you wanna give your best like i remember just saying to them then like you know is there any particular thing you want i was like just be you like i want nicki to be her kind of cool edgy self and i wanted ariana to be sweet and cause i'm not sweet when i
yes i think it's really important to understand the responsibility as well like you have and how many people especially young young people that are watching you and that you they're like oh they get on and everyone's like oh did you not get on and this that and the other i'm like no we got on really well and had fun and enjoyed each other's differences
live in fear but i don't live in denial that's kind of my thing i don't live for other people but i'm very aware of the responsibility that i have the
and there are things that you know i'm gonna do and things that people shouldn't see that at certain ages however i think it's important to just know like my niece is seven and you know i want her to be able to i want her to be able to listen to my album and not have to skip a track or my sister worry about
is but i think it's really important just to adapt you know not not change myself but just be respectful you know i've put myself in their shoes and how i would've felt seeing something that maybe i wasn't i was like that's
i feel like i've really understood what i'm good at what i'm not good at what i should
um the good and the bad and i feel like this new album sweet talker is a great
ooh i like colorful food people always laugh at me cause i just make everything with different colors the vegetables and
on on a daily basis depending on what mood i'm in one of my personal favorites is seal me with a kiss cause it features de la
it just represents the kind of music that i grew up listening to kind of brought to now you know and i was so privileged that they were on the
um beyonce is like my dream vocal collaboration kim
blinds like yesterday and i i got here last night and then no they finished the night before and i was gonna pop in and
to watch the show and uh rita's is the new coach on on the series and i'm really excited to see what she brings you know as a coach and
not over so much time like still having the album in at the top fifty even now after like three years kind of makes me go
i don't know um but there's still people that are discovering it obviously that haven't heard it but honestly like you you never know you're in the studio and no one knows you and you're unknown and your passion is
based on everything that you live for everyday and and once the people have the power they can run with it you can't control how many people buy it or tell their friends or enjoy it or come to shows so i feel very very lucky and very
cause you know when you look at your diary as you probably know you look at your diary you don't go right on tuesday and wednesday i'm gonna have a infection i'm gonna get food poisoning on friday you know no one ever imagined right i'm gonna snap my ankle in four
and need reconstructive ankle surgery in the middle of my busiest year of my career so far so
basically what happened was i broke my foot and then went to hospital the a and e people didn't see the break and then did uh a big seventy five thousand people stadium gig the next day with a sock on my foot that people thought was a cast i was in absolute agony then i flew to la the next day
well i think we did six million in the twenty minutes i was on tv we did five underground previous to the show
i actually hadn't had a bob for like a year but i was always people started to like request it
and i was like wait a minute ain't nobody got time for that you know i mean like someone was like
and be a voice of reason you know for young people looking up at their generations going wow that's cool
so yeah so for me like having the opportunity to be an ambassador and be a voice of reason you know for young people looking up
no i think you just write yeah i mean i write my own songs so obviously i can only write about the shoes i walk in and the shoes i was walking in was that of a young woman
clearly i think the core of them are gonna make sure that they kind of relate to young women
yeah i think the new album definitely relates to more i still i'm
i feel like i feel free i feel like i'm in more i'm more in control
phases they've got loads of friends that they don't really need and then you you find things and you know i've recently like discovered things about myself that i never thought i would want for the rest of my life you know with regards
you feel like you found i've found myself and i feel like i lived through a lot of phases in the public eye you know
all the time and the dice in their hair you know and and wannabes and i've been through that but it was in the public eye and i went through the scary kind of
now i'm kind of becoming more of a woman and i feel like i know what my morals are and
i did six hundred events and i was trying to catch up but she's a mom now and one of the biggest selling
glass of wine but it just doesn't agree with me and i've usually gotta work the next day so uh
so that's a big misconception with um big brothers' in school mentoring program you can be paired with um a girl or a boy and you can be male or female ages eighteen and up and uh you'll get paired with somebody that is a good fit for you um i had two little buddies throughout my time with big brothers and they were both females but i could've received
preparation which is actually really great because i think one of my biggest concerns of signing up for big brothers was you know would i be good enough what do we do for fun what's allowed what's not allowed and they were just really wonderful i mean it didn't take a lot of time to just
a bit nervous going in mostly just because i wanted her to think that i was fun and that i was cool and that that she was so happy that she got a cool
and my first five minutes i realized that she was a little bit nervous too so i need to sort of step up my game and show her you know how much fun i was and how much fun we could have and within like five minutes her
but you can pretty much do anything i mean they're very lenient and i'll say uh there was a lot of times with my little buddy that we just had so much fun i felt bad for the other kids
outside skateboarding and playing basketball and making snowmen
first moved to vancouver i felt like i really lacked that sense of community i'm from a small town in northern alberta where there's a lot of kids and a lot of family and i have a
and i missed being around people who were fun and funny and since my my my
with three brothers yeah oh i love it i totally love it and you know um one of the things i love so much about it is people think that it's such a huge time commitment but it's not and you you know you're at work and you're thinking oh my gosh oh my gosh i have to leave in an a half an hour to go and you're sort of in a rush and you're
to do this the second you walk through the school doors it's like having the best lunch break you could ever have you're having fun you're baking and have you're laughing and
you are applying the things that that you know are important in your life to your little buddy and
well um my boss actually told me that the days i perform best were the days that i um did my mentoring because he said i came to work and had so much energy and when i
i had like just a different boost of energy he he i actually was so busy last year with work that he um i talked about maybe
he said that that that no that he would do anything to keep me in the program because it was so important for my success and at work just having
my little buddy actually taught me a lot actually taught me a lot of things um to do with music she taught me how
yeah she um taught me a little bit about life just in terms of
being a girl like i found that ellie was not a tomboy but i'm a little bit more prissy or was i
she just reminded me of my roots of what is really important and to love yourself yes but not to worry
i went to school one day in high heel shoes and she kind of made fun of me for it and i'm like you're right let's get these things off and we just had a great time and she
where you know it's like a friend of a friend and there's an issue and you're able to talk about real life things things like how to deal with somebody not getting along with a friend or how to deal with um you know all
i just found after having those real life conversations with her you could see such a huge difference in the way that she uh not only sees
was very involved with my mentorship with ellie um and i always went into the office and talked to them a little bit
times where she was falling behind a little bit in like in her schoolwork that i just
was fun and that was entertaining and that was hanging out in the class and so ellie actually there was a few times where all of her friends were like oh my gosh you know you get to hang we get to hang out with your big buddy and that became a really positive
clear with ellie when i first started that um i was not a mom and that she you know could she could open up to me and we could have fun and there was sometimes you know she wanted to do things that i knew you know one of my favorite memories was um her and i she brought in two i had a skateboard and she had a skateboard and we were um riding um on
her and i she brought in i had a skateboard and she had a skateboard and we were um riding um
and because i'm so small and it was from the back one of the teachers came up to be like hey kids stop it and then i turned around and i was like and she's like oh okay you're okay cause you're our big
and i fell it was kind of funny because she was with me we could have so much fun and you know the teacher knew that i was looking out for her but that was one of my favorite memories just because she knew that it wasn't gonna be boring it was gonna be fun and we were gonna have a great time and i sometimes i'd go back to work and i'd have like
we all know what it's like it's like oh my gosh i don't know if i have time to go to the gym i don't know if i have time as soon as you go to the gym you're like oh my gosh i love this this i feel so great it's the same thing i think you just have to make that time and it's gonna
advertising and i think you just make it happen and because of i i know how much of a positive impact it has had on my life
do it and you'll realize you fit it in and every time you're finished volunteering for that day it makes a huge difference on the rest of your day and you're
town where i was born and raised is i'm a little bit of a gypsy as i've been all over the place but i would say peace river alberta is where i was born and raised um population maybe seven thousand i think there's maybe two sets of street lights now
theaters couple restaurants but um actually i drive up there from other vancouver
go there once a year i go in may so i'm going again at the end of this may and honestly i mean i think where i'm from has to be
about me you know and just like where i'm from is just like i love sitting around a campfire and smelling like smoke when i go to bed i love four by fouring and going fishing and i love you know now i live in colona um so it's not as small of a town but it's like i travel to new york la or vancouver or calgary and i'm always like working in so many different cities to be able to
back home and know that you can walk to your grandma's or your mom pops over for coffee or my little cousin lives with me to me that's what makes me
antique store and so she used to inspire me a lot to find things that had a story and that really like you know she loved antiques and so as a kid i hated
right but then when i think for me when i started traveling um and you know i've been
so in australia and everywhere you see how much personality and how much of a story in are in all these pieces that you can find around the world so now i think my style is very eclectic and i love antiques so i think growing up in
that are tied to my roots not everybody has to have a deer hanging on their wall but for me it reminds me of where i'm from so just like thinking about certain
our neighbor's garage has a grandma's basement or your parents' garage cause sometimes i just go and
and i knew i wanted to be a designer but i didn't want to go to school for it because i'm incredibly impatient
met scott morrison who is the owner and founder of cactus club or was the owner and founder of cactus club now he um owns browns restaurant and he um
sixty thousand dollars piece of art from like new york and i just i was doing things that like twenty two year olds should not be doing in fact i have a huge gray streak right here probably
wow factors and ignoring the rules and just doing whatever comes naturally to you so like you know cactus browns they're very like mid century and they're modern but yet they're warm and they've got great art and the art speaks to you and i think he taught me a lot about that and he really pushed me really hard like i him and i fought a lot and there was times that i hated him and i thought he hated me and i cried a lot at work but if i had to like say where it all started it would probably be with him like he really pushed me and he used to
call me on weekends or evenings and he'd be like uh no if you wanna get anywhere in life like you have to work more than forty hours a week and i just remember
like oh my god i'm so tired but he pushed me so hard and he taught me so much about design that i'd have to like
been known to go with a point five beer but i wish it was a real beer but i mean i love to be out and i i i hate missing out like i can stay awake till six o'clock in the morning but for
always be up early enough to go to the gym to volunteer to answer my phone to make it to work to do a great job and i think it's just being an honorable person and doing what you say you're gonna do and if you're tired and you're groggy
feel like you can't do it you you have to change something in your life so uh whether that means like i often actually think that
yourself but it's just work hard play hard and you miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take
i think so so having my own furniture line is obviously a huge dream of mine and we're talking with a lot of different um companies right now that would help sort of make that dream come true so no
but it's crazy and and actually i'll admit there was such a huge team that you're always like you're always at one point you're thinking okay we're gonna
something i'm not so i really tried so hard to reeducate people like this is who i am i'm jill the designer i'm jill the designer and i was getting all these offers to do hosting gigs and to do all this stuff and i said i will not go on tv again unless it's something to do with the things i'm passionate about which is fashion design
anything else in tv abc said you know and i was like no no no i am done no more i just wanna get married and live happily
a bachelor or bachelorette application video and i said uh no and she goes why i go i just
now here i am this like twenty seven year old successful designer and you know now i'm gonna go on tv to date somebody i go it just doesn't seem like me and she
the case i should be doing something like extreme makeover home edition like i used to those are the
it is and every single time you know i'm i keep on asking you know michael and ty like do you ever get numb to this do you ever get numb and you don't because every time it's a new family and every time you
you know uh tony parker and eva longoria and all this stuff and you just think these people are famous and so like they're i'm sure they're fine you know i'm sure they're getting a manicure right now but that was a really tough period in my life this last year or whatever because i really actually did think he was someone call me stupid but i really
but i did i did this whole like i'm okay thing i'm okay and then i'm like you know what this is what all of us girls do we pretend we're okay and i was like i'm not okay i'm really sad but i'm gonna
and i actually came to vancouver to um renovate my place and i was gonna sell it cause i wasn't sure if i wanted to live here and i was here for maybe twenty four hours and i completely
think i mean for people who are watching this right now if you haven't driven across the granville bridge or or the lion's gate and you haven't done this to your
fully recover especially when the person who perpetrated the murder of our
has never been brought to justice um it leaves sort of an unresolved
the family was very crippled by the loss of this child and and so it's
and what happens during the course of the story is there's a special surgery that that takes place that changes john and nick's faces they switch faces basically during the course of the story and so john the good guy becomes nick the bad guy with
especially when when nick stats to inhabit john's body how how uh he starts to wreak havoc on the fbi and starts you know killing people off
quickly um uh sort of thrown off thrown off guard i mean the first time she sees him she thinks she
he he has been drinking and so i think she sort of passes it off to oh he's had a little bit too much to drink but he's not really a
just um and so we we tried to drop little things in like that so that hopefully she doesn't seem too you know
his actually um if i could call it favorite was this was a scene when when nick comes into the bedroom um of our home and i see
and i'm coming out of the shower and he really is my husband at that point but he's in nick's body and i see him and i see him as the murderer of my son and and it
sort of being terrorized um because he's trying to explain to me that he's really my husband and i'm just in complete terror that he's going to
it's been such a happy set you know all the people that i've worked with you know are so
the the way he is with people and a lot of it also is the way john travolta and nick cage are with
um john and nick are such incredible actors and you know everybody that's been cast in it has been very very
you know it has a lot of heart in a way i mean ultimately you know in in a way the whole
the whole reason the story takes place is the loss of this child and and so i
what that kind of loss feels like to a family and how it sort of
and and so yeah there's a lot of great fun you know
i love that you know well i grew up in the midwest as i said in a very small town i started doing plays when i was like thirteen years old in my little high school um and i loved it it was i knew that's what i wanted to do and then when i um graduated from college and was fortunate enough to be able to
a good play and sometimes the next one isn't so good but you learned something from it and you know it afforded that kind of um environment to be
you don't you really don't you care deeply about the play that you're doing but it's over in like six weeks and then you get a
just you know i think there are some you know for me there was some amazing romanticism about this woman being a morphine
i think but i i love that kind of i love that kind of thing because i think i grew up in a place where your you know pleasantness was quite was was highly you know
on the you know to it didn't matter you know and you could be
play for a really long time just believing what's written becomes kind of hard because it gets old after a time and you know the veins
but if it's fresh and new and well written you know just looking at the story and thinking of the
differentiation you know i know at times when i talked with gary ross about the character um
you'd be sort of like well and and other other people would say well are are we using
history no fusion you know they were just kind of
to old you know fifties television um role models of what what families were
then yes yeah yeah i well and i grew up in the midwest so you know i had sort of
i think it uh i think it was to a degree you know my mom was a homemaker and she
spend her whole life doing that working really hard raising four children and working in the home and and
her life her childhood what kind of childhood she had what was expected
she would write handwritten thank you notes to people i think that was where she was more comfortable she was more private um but um
her the way she talked cause oliver stone was interested in having me do you know sound a bit like her and and watch her mannerisms and things like that but um
very sympathetic to uh pat nixon's situation
how cool is that that the the king of you know choreographed action sequences
do your you do your thing it mattered the domestic part of that story mattered tremendously to him he was like this this film will not work
um and apparently according to nick hytner and other people there was a stock way to play elizabeth
and i was kinda like well i have no idea what it is cause i've never seen it and i've never read it so let's just
cold i think they were worried about her being too cold and too tied down that that they wanted it to be more about
doing the crucible there were like people who would like say aren't you intimidated you know to you're doing an you know this classic play and that everybody knows and has read and you're working with daniel day lewis who's like one of the greatest you know you know if not the greatest contemporary actor on the planet right now and i was just like well
that time that movie kinda blew my mind it kinda blew my mind um between the godfather films and apocalypse now i was
you know forge ahead and he's he's he's a very accessible person he loves to cook he loves to have people in his
she was like i said i'm sorry the music everything so so my point getting back is when everything
for for for biopics as well cause i love la vie en rose you know i just saw that it was stunning performance you know i um and maybe that harkens back to my teenage years of liking tortured women who are born
the comedies i like you know cause there are there are comedies i love tootsie i love
i was actually when i first saw it i was but i was also so excited for it
wow this is great this is like what an opportunity to do something like this that so belongs and necessary
i of course was familiar with the japanese invasion of china um but the intrigue of the different government
back then was something that i read up on for this film i mean i didn't you know this is historical material that handed handed to me like a whole stack of it but it was very interesting yeah so i did
read you know that's what's great about making any films is that somehow unexpectedly you learn something great and and that part of the history i know the japanese invasion it's of course we know it's taught in every school but the intrigue of that government was not something we read up
she understands that her husband needs this that her
a a serial cheater and he's done this many times before but the only
he's he needs to somehow get rid of some of the
my character knows it's for her for his survival and therefore it's for my survival cause i depend on him
i need to take care of him and so his mistresses are my
and i need to have some control over the situation and so i get to know
that somehow sex is more taboo than violence which is
but first i want to uh thank the organizers of um h pair for inviting me to speak at this wonderful
and uh i also would like to um apologize for not being here in
um as i had planned my flight got canceled twice
creating beings and telling stories that's what all
it is the longing for mutuality that compels us to create art the exchange of
the beloved chilean poet pablo neruda related a story in an essay titled childhood and poetry about how a strange neighbor boy handed him an old but beautiful woolen sheep through the fence and how he ran back into the house and fetched a treasure of his own a pine cone and set it down at the same spot where he was given
that exchange brought home to me for the first time a precious idea that all of humanity is somehow
i have since left my words on the door of so many people who were
sharing is a psyche yet emotional even a spiritual need that must
neither poverty nor starvation neither ridicule nor humiliation can derail the artist from his true
the urgency and the longing to share was what compelled me to write direct and produce a film a story that i must tell or i would
shosho symbolized my generation's blind zeal for the cultural revolution
i had to shoot the film without a government permit because i did not make the changes requested by the
our production went to the high plateaus of tibet which was one of the poorest regions in
the air was so thin weather so severe and food so unpalatable that the crew almost had a mutiny we didn't have any green vegetables or a shower for an entire month and there was also the constant danger of being discovered by the authorities and being arrested or
this was nineteen ninety seven before the era of satellite telephone or internet we had no communication whatsoever with the outside
before embarking on my unknown journey i made my last call to my husband in san francisco from chengdu the final city where there was international phone
and he told me that i could stop and turn back that no one would love me any less for
of the ship i said if the titanic must go down then i will go down
laughable when i think about it now but the risks were real
shosho was by far the hardest but the most gratifying project i have
the film received many awards internationally and i was honored by the national board of review with the international freedom of expression
but when i set out to do the film all i wanted was to tell the story and winning awards were the farthest thing on my
the sharing of a story that is deeply personal and important to me was my way of reaching through the fence to give a priceless
an organization that promotes the mutual understanding of the peoples between united
we're currently doing a video project called youth voices on china in which young people share their feelings and thoughts on what china means to them it is wonderful to see the young people reaching across neruda's fans their internet with a peace
one film particularly resonates with me it is from a deaf mute chinese young man who has been adopted by
the urgency in his silent voice is deeply personal and piercing there is nothing generic about it no one likes to be given a gift that can be from just anyone
gift giving across the fence is in my mind what international relations is all about like neruda's exchange with the strange neighbor boy once shared the gift enters the realm of the spirit and lodges in someone's mind and soul
everything she does it comes out of that love um uh the most
it it doesn't happen but anyway in that world in that um time um that's a way of life that that's how they
also you know if they get on with age it's like okay let the younger ones do
uh but um uh the one book that was helpful was called i
mongol queens um it just talked about
they are really all strong they actually they were on horseback they were in battlefields
they were holding half of this guy and so that is a good
um other than that um you know if you google um there's probably ten sentences you know you you wouldn't be able to find much um about her but what was found that was interesting that she was a
her compassion was known and so when they conquered uh many parts of the world you
children that she adopted like one of the uh child uh
was a character of the finest minister in in the show
and and actually people that they have conquered she actually raised the the offering
much more organized than i am and she's much she's a lot of her father you know you forget
um yeah and it makes me terribly sad that i see that because i know after i'm dead
or gee i wonder if i hurt my mother when i said that and she will never think that until her son says something to her and she'll go
moving out to los angeles til it was all done you know what i'm saying i never even said what do you think you think i should go i just called up one day and said we're going next
my mother never said a thing to me but she said to her friend it broke my heart never said a thing
they think they're all so strong and they can be sixty five when their mother goes they
to jo i'm lucky i they've really known my life i can't explain it uh people know they used to know me when i was single they knew me when i got married they knew me when i had melissa and they certainly a lot of them picked up when edgar committed suicide my husband when i was fired from fox so it's just an
all such different you know there's so many aspects to all our personalities uh it depends on what the assignment
uh the uh my assignment on fashion police is to tell the truth
my job my allegiance is to my audience and my audience i always think of would be friends if i was sitting in my living room and we were looking at these pictures this is what i would say about so and so this is what i would say about so so that's fashion police uh
on qvc my allegiance is the ladies that wanna make the
goes with that cause they wanna sell both and i'll say no it doesn't
cause i don't want to look like fools so it's it's always really who
i think is one of the reasons that this society is just falling to pieces we're all so terrified to say anything everyone is pulling the race card you know
whether i'm a woman and you touched me oh calm down and that's why you fired me we fired you cause you're stupid that's why we fired
whether uh it goes back to political correctness for god's sake stop and look at this and uh so comedy is rough and uh i like that i like that you can talk about things that everyone says you can't talk about yes you
what they laughed at was different and maybe that was very shocking then but right now
the new york times sadie schwartz a hundred and six suddenly not so
be loved if you think you're fabulous as you are how lucky
and carriages went on booze i was just but i i don't drink i don't drug
books buying books loved their bookstores and a
then you do very little you do what you can you get botox which will take a lot of the wrinkles
it's your face do what you want if they wanna do it and they wanna look too much that's their business are they happy if they're
exec read or many of them do not wanna be interviewed then don't walk down the carpet then why are you there because all
you said to me tonight oh and i drink you know jim and i take uh an extra grapefruit every day i'd go
that's when it happened after the korean war and now unfortunately uh again because we're having so many
i was funny by the time i was in the third grade that i can make people laugh not class clown but
witty i knew i was verbally very funny so that was great and uh i still don't have a career but it's a very
seventy was the first time i really made some money in the business that i didn't have to have two day jobs and
it's fascinating it still fascinates me i i get so to go into an area ephesus in greece and they dig down you find an entire civilization then you figure out what was happening there
i think i probably would've certainly yeah anthropology and and
that didn't go into drugs or that didn't that worked at
worked at it i mean i went to every audition uh tried to get into every play made it and those uh it's it's amazing
and that's why you see so many kids with one records you know one record wonders or whatever they call them and so many people that will go into one sitcom and never heard of again they don't get it that's the time to get busy and say okay i'm lucky i've made it this far i'm gonna make sure i have a a solid base and i i really always
and so i got on by mistake and when i finally got on i just knew i'm very lucky and i better go right and start writing my next
do you edit this they're a bunching of fucking liars what they were they were not grooming me they were never and a friend of mine was a vp
the list and said darling you should know i'll never forget he wrote it right across the top darling you should be aware of this
and that was what made us move over to fox cause she realized they would never use a woman in that spot
i was coming off and thinking these are great shows and what is this and then they finally stood up and i came off and the stage manager said my god they haven't stood up in
the emmy was great uh uh uh i've gotten a tony nomination which is great because it was against uh diana
and still viable i think it's it's my thing that i'm
current yeah and i look at in the audiences it's tremendously uh
but you look out in the audience and they're all young people it's the older ones that get upset with me it's the older ones that care
uh reddy brothers uh was wonderful because it takes you one step away and you can also see how they took a joke and
i from the time i could put two sentences together i knew this is what i wanna do and
you cannot have a a comfortable audience in comedy they've gotta be right with you gotta
no i think life is so tough no no no no no you must laugh
the ones that have cancer which is so awful i'm so sick of them you know their problems you know can i borrow a cup of bone marrow you know i got my own i just gained eight pounds you know they're
you know would you leave your six year old son with him no so
uh it annoys me now with plastic surgery very much
everybody gets it i hate hypocrisy i hate when someone sits there and says to you i
say to women the truth is we're a society that wants you to look young and wants you to look beautiful
i i know that sounds i had no concept i didn't think i was gonna win i truly did not think i was gonna win i
and we're in the world everything is just fabulous my life is fabulous i'm never
so i i didn't know how lucky i am but i also look at meryl streep
nineteen thirty eight and they said we're going to reissue it would you have a look at it and see if you'd like to write a forward and i opened it up and i thought are they doing this as a kind of joke because it seems so old fashioned you know brushing your hair back and tying your curls loosely with a
but the more i read it the more i thought do you know this something that's absolutely enchanting it's a way that young women were told how to
um i went on the as a modeling course and i was only there for a month cause courses were only a month in those days but while we were doing a
charm meant knowing how to lay a table properly and how how to arrange flowers and how to
and princess anne was coming down to open this beautiful new farm
at sir davidson welsh welsh welsh right in the forest it was jolly cold and all the children were in gumboots and were all wrapped up like this and princess anne arrived and
was terribly nice and very approachable and was wearing a headscarf one of the children said will she be wearing a
and lots of time on your own it's a time for mucking about you also have the great the great benefit of hearing different languages
learned it by people who who were of that language of understanding and hearing the different religions you know the calling the temple bells the you had you had a sort of sense
um a lot of them were gurkhas and my father was was there with sections of his regiment and some of the gurkha men were there too and there were some of the most ghastly things but in one particular um skirmish which was at mogong which is a fighting with the japanese and these terrible jungle conditions the two vcs were awarded one was to a man michael ormand who died and so it was
there is this tremendous guy cassandra called tul bahadur pun and i knew this face and name ever since i was
tul bahadur pun wind the clock forward maybe fifty years sixty years and suddenly tul bahadur pun vc who's
very frail and his condition got weaker and weaker and he couldn't get the medical treatment that he needed out in nepal and wondered whether he could come and be domiciled in this country
and so there was a great deal of banging and crashing and banging and suddenly they went oh sorry what we meant was no he can come in so he did come in thank goodness so he told
actually the police came and it uh and it was all done i did feel sorry for him because there was something wrong with that but um i do think i hated it when people said in the old days don't have a go
and then hold it we used to have to fire and we used to have to shoulder roll the gun so i knew about guns and so the sight
motorbike and they gave me a quarter and i said they said can you ride a bike i said no i can't not a motorbike they said we'll give you a quarter of an hour to
so um uh so i didn't do those but i did quite a lot of strange ones the worst the one which i know
noose hanging underneath it a little ladder now look it's just gonna hover above you all you've got to do is just step on the ladder be careful you don't step right on it you'd pull the helicopter down on you and you don't want that
no i don't want that sure and they said so just wait till it's there and just hang on to it then just hang on tight we're just gonna take you a little ways around little two or three
and so i just read them and i thought this is very good and so i paid her a small amount of money and she
it's it isn't a thing but you see they weren't all written and jennifer's a very good writer i hate to say this in front of her but she's very good because she
you sort of right along she she grows the part with the way that you're
purdey who was a policewoman really that's what she was undercover agent she didn't smoke she didn't drink she had no boyfriends she was completely good and sapphire in sapphire and steel which i think you may have seen it here in france she was an alien
she was very good and she was correct and always on the side of good and it was such a relief for me as a very
nearing the end of my career to be allowed to just break out and not be always looking good always always being charming
be charming and to look attractive it's a great freedom for women not to have to look attractive
charming it was nice not to have to be charming and to look attractive it's a great freedom for women not to have to look attractive
it's always the ones who are the terrible ones that are staying out late everybody's up worrying about the children in this case complete reversal little little sappy the daughter anxious always mom don't come
so it's a different way it happens but it it hasn't been shown before nobody's shown it that way problem
it's quite odd because they do expect me now to be patsy and they write articles that i'm smoking all the time drinking like a fish dragged out by my
around us the most important people in the world eleanor still appears there even though she was there with the plays in eleven eighty three i mean it's she was phenomenally powerful and famous unmatched in
lunch or in patsy's case not lunch ever because she hasn't eaten since about nineteen seventy three um had all her organs removed in any case i mean it just got funnier and funnier the more we the more jennifer wrote the more we
never we're very po everybody actors are very po faced about alcohol because it doesn't help it's a nightmare and if anybody and i have had it somebody sneaked me something during a show and i said
it slurs your tongue you don't think it does you think you're being brilliant but it's um it's a monster to be very steady be
two days up diving into the river the river cam at cambridge i knew it was
mid november absolutely freezing and they had a diver in case i got drowned in the weeds and they kept giving me a brandy between takes and i said i don't wanna drink it they forced me to drink cause i'd gone
to pay paul i mean it's wonderful for the commercial world who are kind enough to have you to do two days' shoot where you are treated like a
it sounds brilliant and plenty of money at the end of it whereas acting is quite often the equity minimum
can't remember the photographer but i remember those are my own boots i loved
if you really really think somebody is fantastic never let her see you
she goes what what what why didn't he i mean he could've come over he's bloody staring at me all the time
a a very few but but they were but it was love i mean it seems to me love i think some people are head turningly
uh something's it's like slamming into a piece of glass doors or something the shock is so colossal that you
so absolutely not but having said that i don't blame anybody who does it for start i've heard you get a sack of gold for
eating uh the crow to the insects i'm an animal lover and i'm vegetarian and i absolutely hate they way they always it's like kind of
ought to do something else put money into a show of mine or something like that but that's the truth the media will hate them but
but we didn't know the result would come in that time and we were prepared to hang on even up till now
sweet to say the same i kind of like things being slightly different i've had the great good
and that's what i love doing because i've always believed that geography and history should be taught together i believe that we are stupid in how little we teach our children i think we patronize our children and we patronize our viewers we don't realize how clever people are and how much they want to know and so i would just like to say here's stuff here's stuff and you you learn about stuff not but i'll learn with you look at this look at this open up the glories of the
do you realize you're one of the richest countries on the planet do you know even cutting back by fifty percent we're going to be richer than anybody else on the planet so
everything that's what i said to somebody before i said in a word everything i feel
to get to do the work that i love to do and then on top of it i get to be honored by my
to be here in new york and to be on broadway and to get to work with this amazing team that i'm working with in
this is really extraordinary i think i'm still a little bit in shock about it too i'm trying to come present in my body and and and for me i just wish that my whole team was nominated you know you don't do these things alone you cannot do them alone i mean i couldn't be doing this without thomas kale uh our director and and dan loria and all my guys in the show i mean you know
and do this by yourself and and eric simonson our extraordinary playwright and
thomas kail uh our director and and dan lauria and all my guys in the show i mean you know bill dawes and rob riley and chris sullivan and keith nobbs i mean and you just cannot do this by yourself and
uh marie lombardi was really an extraordinary person and she had us
support but whenever the players had a problem with vince they went to marie so to play a woman with that kind of stature and a very dry sense of humor
i it's that's a complicated question and it's a very good question um there there was processed along the way
um i remember when i first started working on the voice so things were being put into play all the time and i did a lot of work on my own um just the process of thinking about her and reading david's book and i chose not to listen to any
tapes that they gave me on her or any of the video that they had on her and i asked uh thomas kail and eric simonson and i said can i
because i don't want to do an impersonation of her and i don't want to do a caricature of her and i'm afraid i might so might i just do what comes as we're in rehearsal with the work on my own and see where it goes so then one day in
i said okay you guys if eric simonson said to me you're walking differently and i he said i said is that okay and he said yes i like it and tommy just kept an eye on me so it was
when i first rise from that living room set and begin talking to keith nobbs and then continue talking to dan lauria that i i experience it afterwards that i
knew also that i had worked with jeffrey forty years ago at the milwaukee repertory
that she knew how i felt about him she knew that he and i had done uh other things through the years i played his girlfriend on a series that he did with john lithgow that was very short lived called
the thing about jill is that it was important to her to put together a group of people
and i knew that this would change that and i knew what jeffrey would do with this i knew the
ability level that he would take for creating this character
and she creates a context for the work where you are physically connecting with people out of like she'll say a line like or jill will say a line like will you still love me if
and then joan starts talking to you about how to move with somebody
the cinematographer jimmy frohna came and jill was part of the work and the first ad and the
all the actors and everybody was working off the scene
and so when you first watch transparent you say oh that's a family
those people and that was what she wanted to created and that is exactly what she created was this
drive each other insane but at the same time there was this depth of love that they carried with them
it's addictive they can't stop watching it now i'm not a binge watching person
and we really have to be careful that we maintain that level
um uh moira is sitting there and she's just had this big fight
and you love them and so i think that's true about every one of those characters and in particular shelly and of course in the later
when ed is dying and you find out that she has i don't know how much of it you
i remember jill saying things to me about when i was doing it and she said go deeper go go from down
and i say and he's the one who's been here for me none of you kids and something in he
and we did that over and over again until jill got it exactly the way that she wanted it
shelly's doing and and there were times when jill would say to me don't look at them just don't look at them or she would say say that line and just get out of the room get out of the room so that what she's created what we've created
is this person that's not necessarily connected
the progression of a character over ten episodes so that you don't get that
off you write shelly off you say oh she's this way and then you go no
the information that's given if you don't block it and make it about yourself or your ego
jill and everybody else jeffrey and amy and gaby and jay duplass so genius and
and then the work with joan and the cinematographer and the crew and everybody who's involved gives the platform of support and safety
court i believed that family court should be all courts should be open to
because i honestly believe and i believe to this day that the only thing that closed
the public pays for a very expensive judicial system and the public has a right to see that it's
uh josh was writing a three part series for the los angeles times on people in from different parts of the country that shake the bureaucratic
and that piece came out on a valentine's day i don't remember when it was probably nineteen ninety four around
minutes and they said you know we read this article and we'd really like to come and see how
well if you're gonna walk the talk the talk you gotta walk the walk so i
you can't come in with a whole bunch of lights and everything you can have one camera over in the corner and you can't show the faces of any minors
and you always take a chance with sixty minutes because you never know how they're going to portray you
that was a risk i had to take because i said i'm not changing the way i do business
you come in and see it and if you see it and if you agree with it report it fairly that's all you
and morley safer was the correspondent and he came and he reported what he
i mean you can't say if you watched me work for a month they were there for month can't say i was
but they first of all they said that morley safer was doing it and i saw morley safer you look like a nice enough fellow
i mean you can't say if you watch me work for a month they were there for a month you can't say i was
can't say that i didn't know my business i knew my business can't say i lacked perspective i had a perspective and there was a rational basis for my
if you wish to conduct your business in a different way but you can't fault me for being
because there's really nothing wrong with you and they find you building a deck on your back porch and you're collecting two thousand dollars a month because you hurt your
right and we had cheats like that in the family court all the time
i think big government and big corporations and they cheat all the time i said but i don't work there this is where i
you want me to say well they were only cheating a little bit and a lot of people in different in different vocations different professions are cheating a lot therefore i will do nothing i mean that's ridiculous is that what you're
the way i conducted my business and so while i had you of course have reservations and jerry and i instead of having a sixty minutes party where we invited all our family and friends just to watch it together we i remember sitting that night in our bedroom
door and just the two of us watching it and when it turned out to be a what we considered a favorable piece we went to
on first avenue in manhattan and met my friends elaine and barry
who was to become my longtime literary agent jane dystel and she said to me judge sheindlin i really think that you should write a book i think you have a perspective and i think that your perspective should be told you know there are a lot of academic types that write books on the family court and psychologists and sociologists and therapists and
group of folks who write and they became they become the texts for study i think you have another perspective
how it sort of would break the spell the show has been such a
because so many of those shows that did win are no longer with us so i say to myself you want the emmy
because i think if you try as a judge slash television person
and keep your perspectives your personal perspectives a secret
viewing audience could tell when somebody's not being honest when somebody is peeing on their leg
it was because i don't filter myself very well but i was never a great filterer of myself even when i sat on the bench in new york oh sometimes that got you into a little bit of hot
and if you annoy me or if you lie to me or if i feel as if you're trying to
would judy say um you know the book which comes out which came out yesterday for
actually my literary agent has been on my back for about three or four years and said judy you know you haven't written a book in a long time people want to know what you're thinking
easy way for me to communicate with some of my fans on the on a website and exchange ideas with me because i've had lots of experience but i can't compete with the experience of
some and where do you start in the arc you start in the arc of living together because young people now
who live together before they decide whether they are permanent partners so i threw out a question on my website i say you must have stories about living together with benefits you know my time
didn't leave home unless you were married or dead and that's the way you left home white dress or a pine
you're both living in sin checking up there are all kinds of things now everybody does it you know it started i think with the
yeah particularly with regard to any celebrity but i certainly think from the standpoint of the
and that's not a good thing if justice is supposed to be blind it's supposed to be blind for celebrity and
um retiring i am having a ball i am having such a good time that why would i wanna give that up and do what
i can't actually think of what i would do if i were not working we
had a very long week and it's been a long day today and i'm still doing fine and what time is it it's now four o'clock in the afternoon and i mean if i were home and been up since five o'clock in the morning i'd be ready for my
favorites are but i get a lot of i love when you say um is
and he was talking to people who barely got out of second
and i got out of second grade but even i couldn't understand
most of the time that to me was very unfair i mean if you if you're putting somebody in jail and
one woman said to a young girl that she was sending to a reformatory she said the young girl started to cry she said i don't want you to cry i know exactly the way you feel when i was your age my parents sent me to paris for the summer and i didn't wanna
and we all stood there with this look of incredulity i was a prosecutor
i would i remember my parents sent me to paris when i
one judge said to a young man who was fifteen who he was sending away to jail he said to him i want you to know that this period of incarceration is going to have a very prophylactic
so this has to be plain speak so liar liar pants on fire people understand baloney people understand um is not an answer beauty fades dumb is forever i want you to think about that
i went i remember my parents sent me to paris when i was sixteen and i didn't wanna go
in the way she related to these people and one judge said to a young man who was fifteen who he was sending away to jail he said to him i want you to
and we did a long time and we i guess we finished that thing about three years ago three and a half years ago so it's um but it sure was a heck of a lot of
i'm not sure i i i i i mean i think it was extraordinary that we all were lucky enough to come together but once we came together it was sort of there i mean i don't think there was sort of i don't think there was magic beyond that i mean it was just a a a great
for a really long time uh and i have two um children
so that's what i did i didn't have an a work agenda at all um and and then i would say
curb your enthusiasm and i don't know that was exciting and
even if the same thing was good i needed to make a different thing and um so he came up with
right we have real time and one camera so it's very different than doing the kind of television that i had been used to doing you it's shot like a movie so it's very uh you know you don't rehearse for three days and then
we did that's how we did seinfeld for the most part you shoot every single day and each episode takes about five days to shoot and then of course he real time is this puzzle for everybody in terms
telling the story and of course in terms of kind of continuity of coming around a corner and making sure that
sort of ensemble work and uh improvisational we're a team and stuff like that
well the uh i knew larry david larry david was a writer on snl and that's how come he sent me these seinfeld scripts cause he knew me and uh so that's something that good that came out of
yeah that was nice it was great and when we were doing and when i read those scripts of larry's and i thought god are we gonna be able to get away with this because that show was not written like most television
the conversations were not particularly meaningful they were small conversations that were
in fact we're doing thirteen this season and then subsequent seasons will be fifteen and uh i'm which i'm you know delighted that we've been able to to
what's my passion um i would say i'm passionate about the
um work uh for the environment um but
besides that i just really enjoy making people laugh that's my thing that's
no idea it is uh i have to say in in if you didn't see it and
in in the episode i was in the cold open and so which is sort of
i haven't because lehrer was there my third year on the show he was there for a year and we were
and that was in nineteen eighty four eighty five so the fact of us being back there you know i mean how many years ago is that that's like
that i don't really have any i recently came to a conclusion which is
but the cooking thing except for baking when i and i am in fact a good
every year for his birthday that's what he asks for instead of a cake i make him a key lime pie but you know lemon squares orange cake i've got it i've got it covered but if you want like you know chicken parmesan you'll have to go out
i mean you know it was camping and beside the river and and and but it was unbelievable to be in that environment and to see that natural
in fact we have this one thing that happened we 'cause you know we were all actually rafting we had a you know you'd have a guide
but in a weird way it does it's um it's a whirlwind making this show uh but it's so much fun you've no idea what a good
upcoming season uh in which it that begins uh the first episode of season five begins about seven hours after the last episode of season four so it's fun
that's my advice my other advice would be don't take any advice from selina meyer if what if selina meyer
for a couple of reasons um first of all it did take a while for the show to become
i was having my babies during this period of time i have two boys who are not babies
you know who was gonna be on the final episode and i was so shocked that
on occasion and um in fact we got together uh i guess it was last year um and we did
it's a couple things first of all i think it's a sort of lightning in a bottle a lot of good
particular vision we were left alone to our own devices people didn't get in our way
very good time and genuinely enjoy what you're doing and and and believe in it truly you know you're not faking it at all um i think that
ends the tyranny of oil man that was great except i just checked and right now big oil is still pretty much running the show but mr president you've got a fabulous chance to turn that around and
house um did the right thing on the keystone uh pipeline and and didn't allow it to go forward
not an expert i'm not a scientist so and i don't pretend to be um but i like i say i sort of use my celebrity to to to to help and also frankly as a citizen you know i like to be vocal and i vote
the way that the politics and white house and capitol have been portrayed i think in the past very well
between the two it's uh it's a show about political behavior and
and um and he's the uh genius creator behind this show and the director he has a a
there for the artist and the and and and what your
all women in government i think that uh being uh a a woman in a position of power um is tricky
it's it's hard to be a political person male or female by the
because all of these issues are are you know transvaginal probes and
oh yeah but i like my my guys i mean it's really funny because i come from
i'd it's not an snl battle um the uh but who's funnier i don't know i don't know how to answer that we have a good time together um and we share the same interests and and um and i he's just a good a good companion i think we're just
