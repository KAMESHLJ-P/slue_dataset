that	O

it	O
now	O
when	O

we	O

most	O

all	O
we	O
need	O
to	O

they	O

poverty	O

i	O
am	O
encouraged	O
by	O
the	O
engagement	O

we	O

then	O
the	O

some	O

my	O

it	O

time	O

to	O
just	O

think	O
through	O
the	O

are	O

are	O

ineffective	O

of	O

the	O

the	O

of	O
these	O

seems	O
clear	O
the	O

and	O

europe	B-LOC
that	O
estonia	B-GPE
wants	O
to	O
promote	O
as	O
the	O

if	O
the	O

these	O

i	O

confident	O
and	O
convinced	O
that	O
in	O
the	B-DATE

to	I-DATE

estonia	B-GPE
will	O
go	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
denouncing	O
any	O

of	O
fundamental	O

in	O
the	O
european	B-GPE

i	O
question	O
the	O
validity	O
of	O
reach	B-LAW
to	O
do	O
so	O
because	O
so	O
far	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
restricted	O
one	B-CARDINAL
single	O
substance	O
using	O
the	O
reach	B-LAW
system	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
my	O
question	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
really	O
appropriate	O
and	O
if	O
it	O
will	O
work	O

let	O
me	O
say	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
policy	O
shift	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
strategic	O
blunder	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
should	O
continue	O
to	O
do	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
doing	O
only	O
do	O
it	O
better	O

therefore	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
recent	O
events	O
in	O
russia	B-GPE
and	O
the	O
presidential	O
elections	O
actually	O
present	O
a	O
case	O
for	O
staying	O
the	O

in	O

of	O
our	O
policy	O

iran	B-GPE
sees	O
some	O
of	O

as	O
threats	O
repression	O
happens	O
to	O
real	O
people	O
people	O
with	O

so	O
my	O
question	O
is	O
basically	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
commission	O
doing	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
these	O

it	O

that	O

such	O

for	O

glad	O
that	O
the	O

the	O
eu	B-GPE
needs	O
to	O

the	O

in	O
the	O
osce	B-ORG

that	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
to	O

i	O
really	O
appreciate	O
that	O
you	O

i	O
would	O
really	O

that	O

you	O
in	O

so	O
yes	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
this	O
huge	O

we	O
will	O
still	O
need	O
fossil	O

for	O

and	O
i	O
expect	O
the	O

to	O
move	O
forward	O
in	O
this	O

in	O
its	O

no	O
our	O

in	O

also	O

this	O

know	O
that	O

condemn	O
the	O

as	O
clearly	O

as	O
unequivocally	O
as	O
this	O

does	O
because	O
only	O

we	O
going	O

unfortunately	O

i	O
am	O
baffled	O
at	O
the	O
notion	O

seventy	B-DATE

ninety	B-DATE
five	I-DATE

and	O
i	O
am	O
baffled	O
by	O
it	O
not	O
just	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
dubious	O
and	O
almost	O
out	O
of	O

with	O
the	O
digital	O

but	O
also	O
because	O
quite	O
clearly	O
a	O
move	O

that	O
will	O
primarily	O

i	O
believe	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
hard	O
work	O
and	O
goodwill	O
that	O
meps	O
should	O
reject	O
this	O

it	O
is	O
a	O
proposal	O
which	O
i	O
believe	O
will	O
ultimately	O
reward	O
those	O
artists	O
that	O
are	O
already	O
successful	O
and	O
indeed	O
reward	O
the	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
commission	O
needs	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
drawing	O
board	O
and	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
right	O
proposal	O
one	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
about	O
supporting	O
performers	O
and	O
artists	O
but	O
that	O
in	O
real	O
and	O
practical	O
terms	O
will	O
deliver	O
precisely	O
that	O

for	O
all	O
iraqi	B-NORP
citizens	O
in	O
general	O
and	O
the	O
turkmen	B-NORP
in	O

because	O
they	O

we	O

this	O

the	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
wrong	O

mr	O

because	O
they	O

they	O
would	O

you	O
must	O

a	O

your	O

about	O
the	O

we	O

i	O
have	O

this	O
is	O

my	O

but	O
i	O
also	O
eagerly	O
await	O
the	O

they	O

so	O
it	O

also	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

by	O

which	O

this	O

and	O
having	O
a	O

than	O
we	O
had	O
before	O

so	O
we	O
are	O
seeing	O
improvements	O
every	O

but	O
we	O
fully	O
realise	O
as	O
member	O

as	O
the	O

that	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
there	O

a	O

i	O

already	O

from	O

of	O

let	O
me	O

from	O
the	O

perspective	O
and	O
the	O

that	O
this	O

not	O
a	O

it	O

that	O
we	O

unfortunately	O
for	O

that	O

we	O
took	O
sixteen	B-CARDINAL
additional	O

together	O
with	O
the	O

the	O

and	O
those	O

relate	O
to	O

they	O
relate	O
to	O

to	O

well	O
as	O
the	O

for	O

but	O
also	O
at	O
the	O
last	O

it	O
was	O
clear	O
that	O
many	O

have	O
stated	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
again	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
additional	O
measures	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
linked	O
to	O
a	O
reduction	O
of	O
milk	O

you	O
see	O
an	O
average	O
increase	O
of	O
milk	O
production	O
of	O
about	O
between	O
five	B-CARDINAL
and	O
six	B-CARDINAL
but	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
every	O
member	O
state	O
so	O
whilst	O
stating	O
that	O
we	O
need	O
a	O
european	B-NORP
answer	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
we	O
need	O
flexibility	O
for	O
the	O

to	O
implement	O

which	O
are	O

for	O
the	O

mr	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
thank	O
all	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
parliament	B-ORG
for	O
their	O
remarks	O
but	O
also	O
for	O
their	O
suggestions	O
and	O
certainly	O
the	O
presidency	O
will	O
take	O
them	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
our	O
next	O
discussion	O
in	O
the	O
council	B-ORG
of	O
june	B-DATE
because	O
there	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
discuss	O
again	O
the	O
very	O
severe	O
situation	O
in	O
the	O
dairy	O
sector	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
need	O
for	O
additional	O
measures	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
reiterate	O
what	O
was	O
said	O
by	O
commissioner	O
hogan	B-PERSON
that	O
the	O
commission	O
and	O
the	O
council	B-ORG
were	O
not	O
resting	O
on	O
their	O
laurels	O

many	O
measures	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
not	O
only	O
in	O
september	B-DATE
but	O
also	O
in	O
march	B-DATE
and	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
see	O
some	O
effects	O
of	O
those	O
measures	O
perhaps	O
not	O
enough	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
effects	O
of	O
those	O
measures	O
and	O
the	O
situation	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
worse	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
taken	O
those	O
measures	O

and	O
yes	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
reiterate	O
that	O
we	O
need	O
a	O
european	B-NORP
approach	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O
council	B-ORG
also	O
stated	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
a	O
quota	O
system	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O
what	O
was	O
said	O
by	O
mr	O
huitema	B-PERSON
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
farmers	O
in	O
the	O
supply	O
chain	O

we	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
fair	O
price	O
for	O
their	O
products	O

therefore	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
market	O
taskforce	O
installed	O
by	O
the	O
european	B-ORG
commission	I-ORG
is	O
so	O
important	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
june	B-EVENT
council	I-EVENT
we	O
have	O
the	O
first	B-ORDINAL
report	O
of	O
this	O
taskforce	O
and	O
hopefully	O
we	O
get	O
some	O
interesting	O
and	O
creative	O
ideas	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
support	O
those	O
farmers	O
and	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
help	O
them	O
balancing	O
supply	O
and	O
demand	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
dutch	B-NORP
model	O
of	O
the	O
dutch	B-NORP
government	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
the	O
dutch	B-NORP
model	O
of	O
the	O
dutch	B-NORP
dairy	O
producers	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
looking	O
into	O
niche	O
markets	O
into	O
improving	O
quality	O
into	O
new	O
market	O
concepts	O

but	O
they	O
are	O
also	O
now	O
at	O
this	O
moment	O
discussing	O
possibilities	O
of	O
reduction	O
of	O
the	O
milk	O
production	O
in	O
the	O
netherlands	B-GPE
on	O
a	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
council	B-ORG
in	O
june	B-DATE
to	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
support	O
those	O
initiatives	O
of	O
farmers	O
organisations	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
milk	O

that	O
's	O
always	O
appreciated	O
and	O
i	O
believe	O
we	O
have	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
good	O

because	O
the	O

that	O

that	O

a	O

you	O

some	O

this	O

a	O

what	O

not	O

what	O

the	O

we	O

be	O
created	O
at	O
the	O

the	O

then	O
to	O
regulate	O

some	O

you	O
may	O
have	O
wondered	O
why	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
cheaper	O
to	O

because	O
in	O
the	O

this	O

is	O
not	O
much	O
more	O

that	O
