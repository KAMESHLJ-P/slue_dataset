the	O

domestic	O
opposition	O
thus	O
far	O
seems	O
to	O
move	O
the	O
iranian	B-NORP
regime	O
more	O
than	O
international	O

so	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
clear	O
indicator	O

iran	B-GPE
is	O
on	O
our	O
political	O
agendas	O
but	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
is	O
mainly	O
preoccupied	O
with	O
the	O
nuclear	O
challenge	O

this	O
is	O
just	O
one	B-CARDINAL
reminder	O
of	O
the	O
brutal	O
things	O
people	O
do	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
the	O

we	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
stop	O

unfortunately	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
sad	O
competition	O
of	O
geographical	O
areas	O
where	O
human	O

take	O
place	O
as	O

as	O

such	O
as	O
women	O

and	O

that	O
need	O
attention	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
being	O
violated	O

over	O
the	O
past	B-DATE
year	I-DATE
the	O
regime	O
has	O
cut	O
off	O
the	O
minimal	O

that	O
the	O

still	O
had	O
and	O
has	O
virtually	O
silenced	O
the	O

i	O
also	O
want	O
to	O
welcome	O
in	O
this	O

the	O

the	O

for	O

the	O

like	O
the	O

itself	O
cannot	O
be	O
an	O
end	O
in	O
themselves	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
crucial	O
test	O
of	O
whether	O
we	O
mean	O
what	O
we	O
say	O

i	O
want	O
to	O
place	O
on	O
record	O
that	O
we	O
are	O

in	O

eu	B-GPE

mr	O

we	O

be	O

of	O
what	O
the	O

in	O

look	O
at	O

we	O

about	O

how	O

her	O

very	O
much	O
on	O

on	O

we	O

this	O

that	O

that	O

what	O

how	O
we	O

their	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
about	O

it	O

to	O

just	O
talking	O
about	O

maybe	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
start	O
even	O
before	O
the	O
summer	O
break	O
to	O
show	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
concern	O
for	O
the	O
interests	O
of	O
european	B-NORP
citizens	O

why	O
are	O
you	O
saying	O
that	O
it	O
doesn	O
't	O
concern	O
you	O

apparently	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
our	O
concern	O

it	O
is	O
our	O
prime	O
concern	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
funny	O
thing	O
is	O
there	O
are	O
only	O
two	B-CARDINAL
countries	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
have	O
citizen	O
based	O
taxation	O

so	O
what	O
is	O
different	O
now	O

so	O
i	O
expect	O
the	O
european	B-ORG
council	I-ORG
to	O
start	O
talks	O
with	O
the	O
united	B-GPE
states	I-GPE
about	O
the	O
abolition	O
of	O
citizen	O
based	O
taxation	O
or	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
least	O
an	O
exemption	O
for	O
eu	B-GPE
citizens	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
your	O
duty	O

one	B-CARDINAL
is	O
the	O
us	B-GPE
the	O
other	O
is	O
eritrea	B-GPE
and	O
when	O
eritrea	B-GPE
came	O
here	O
to	O
europe	B-LOC
and	O
tried	O
to	O
impose	O
taxes	O
on	O
eritrean	B-NORP
citizens	O
here	O
everybody	O
reacted	O

you	O
have	O
just	O
started	O
your	O
presidency	O

but	O
then	O
i	O
made	O
a	O
request	O
for	O
access	O
to	O

and	O
i	O
got	O
fourteen	B-CARDINAL
zero	B-CARDINAL

between	O
the	O
european	B-ORG
commission	I-ORG
and	O
the	O
us	B-NORP

on	O

so	O

so	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
eritrea	B-GPE
off	O
surely	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
the	O

off	O
too	O

we	O
hardly	O
have	O
any	O

with	O
the	O
americans	B-NORP
about	O
this	O

what	O
you	O

is	O
that	O
you	O
consider	O
your	O

the	O

more	O

that	O
's	O

and	O
the	O

that	O

that	O

we	O

that	O
we	O

we	O

it	O

no	O

mr	O
president	O
without	O

detail	O
let	O
me	O
stress	O
that	O
by	O
adopting	O
this	O

the	O

be	O

in	O

with	O
the	O

to	O
make	O
it	O
more	O
effective	O
and	O
intelligible	O
for	O
our	O

it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
turkey	B-GPE
has	O
made	O
progress	O
recently	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
women	O
's	O
rights	O

i	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
turkish	B-NORP
government	O
could	O
take	O
further	O
action	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
prevent	O
early	O
forced	O
marriages	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
taking	O
more	O
action	O
on	O
the	O
more	O

issues	O
of	O
honour	O

mr	O
president	O
in	O
this	O
age	O
of	O
austerity	O
when	O
governments	O
across	O
the	O
world	O
and	O
across	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
are	O
having	O
to	O
tighten	O
their	O
belts	O
and	O
cut	O

it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
we	O
come	O
up	O
with	O

for	O
growth	O
and	O
give	O
confidence	O
to	O
our	O

that	O
we	O
are	O
seeking	O
ways	O
for	O
growth	O
to	O
create	O

indeed	O
it	O
asserts	O
that	O
instead	O
of	O
harmonising	O
criminal	O
law	O
across	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
it	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
prudent	O
to	O

it	O
is	O
much	O
more	O

and	O
thus	O
better	O

to	O
tackle	O
crime	O
in	O
the	O
uk	B-GPE
and	O

mr	O
president	O
the	O
report	O
recognises	O
that	O
criminal	O
law	O
is	O
a	O
highly	O
sensitive	O
policy	O
area	O
and	O
many	O
member	O

feel	O
that	O
their	O

should	O
continue	O

this	O

that	O

it	O

that	O

a	O

to	O

the	O

it	O
is	O

to	O
meet	O
the	O

before	O

it	O
is	O
disturbing	O
to	O

that	O
thirty	B-CARDINAL
nine	I-CARDINAL

have	O
apparently	O

so	O
further	O

i	O
therefore	O
support	O
the	O
turkish	B-NORP

on	O
it	O
to	O
adopt	O
a	O
zero	B-CARDINAL
tolerance	O
policy	O
towards	O

against	O

it	O
is	O

mr	O

the	O

i	O

the	O

the	O

and	O

a	O

i	O
particularly	O

in	O
turkey	B-GPE
in	O
the	O

the	O

is	O
a	O

sign	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
impressed	O
by	O
her	O
strong	O
public	O
assurances	O
that	O
the	O
turkish	B-NORP

is	O
continuing	O

the	O

up	O

of	O
course	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
encouraging	O
the	O
turkish	B-NORP
government	O
to	O
continue	O
on	O
this	O
trajectory	O

whilst	O
we	O
see	O
increasing	O
problems	O
with	O
cross	O

crime	O
including	O
people	O
trafficking	O
and	O
cyber	O
crime	O
which	O
both	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
special	O
ways	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
total	O
sum	O
of	O
human	O
misery	O
we	O
must	O
be	O
careful	O
to	O
develop	O
a	O
very	O
proportionate	O
response	O

i	O
am	O
particularly	O
keen	O
on	O
strengthening	O
the	O
international	O

and	O
making	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O

between	O

there	O
should	O
be	O
no	O
excuse	O
for	O
failure	O
on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
lack	O
of	O
information	O
however	O
there	O
is	O
also	O
much	O
that	O
i	O
cannot	O
support	O

mr	O

i	O
welcome	O
the	O
report	O
on	O
strengthening	O
the	O

of	O

consumers	O
as	O
it	O
will	O
give	O
those	O

an	O
added	O
degree	O
of	O
protection	O
when	O
purchasing	O
goods	O
and	O
products	O
across	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE

the	O
proposals	O
put	O
forward	O
in	O
the	O

are	O
balanced	O
and	O
sensible	O
particularly	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
misleading	O
advertising	O
unfair	O
contract	O
terms	O
and	O
unfair	O
business	O
practices	O

this	O
is	O
always	O
a	O
consideration	O
for	O
my	O
political	O
group	O
and	O
most	O
particularly	O
for	O
my	O
national	O
delegation	O
of	O
british	B-NORP
conservatives	I-NORP

of	O
course	O
we	O
should	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
implications	O
of	O
creating	O
such	O
eu	B-GPE
criminal	O
law	O
and	O
the	O
political	O
and	O
economic	O
costs	O
but	O
we	O
know	O
from	O
so	O
much	O
experience	O
that	O
looking	O
at	O
reviewing	O
and	O
developing	O
an	O
approach	O
so	O
very	O
often	O
turns	O
into	O
an	O
overweening	O
desire	O
to	O
legislate	O
regulate	O
and	O
impose	O

i	O
simply	O
cannot	O
support	O
that	O
whilst	O
i	O
see	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
individual	O
issues	O
in	O
this	O
report	O
are	O
well	O
crafted	O
and	O
thoughtful	O
it	O
simply	O
does	O
not	O
outweigh	O
my	O
belief	O
that	O
each	O
member	O
state	O
is	O
best	O
placed	O
to	O
make	O
its	O
own	O
decisions	O

i	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
report	O
was	O
an	O
interesting	O
one	O
the	O
approach	O
was	O
thoughtful	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
certain	O
bits	O
i	O
could	O
agree	O
with	O

i	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
corruption	O
organised	O
crime	O
terrorism	O
radicalisation	O
cyber	O
crime	O
challenges	O
to	O
border	O
management	O
and	O

all	O
represent	O
major	O
threats	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
european	B-GPE
union	I-GPE
and	O
to	O
the	O
lives	O
of	O
its	O
citizens	O
therefore	O
concrete	O
action	O
must	O
be	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
relevant	O
bodies	O
in	O
order	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
fight	O
against	O
these	O
threats	O
but	O
also	O
to	O
prevent	O
them	O

i	O
support	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
mutual	O
recognition	O
in	O
practice	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
extend	O
the	O
scope	O
of	O
eu	B-GPE
harmonised	O
law	O
but	O
rather	O
to	O
promote	O
cooperation	O
between	O
judiciaries	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
equally	O
reliable	O
and	O
share	O
the	O

level	O
of	O

and	O
integrity	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
comment	O
following	O
what	O
i	O
heard	O
from	O
my	O
british	B-NORP
colleagues	O
in	O
particular	O

we	O
need	O
a	O
strategy	O
to	O
protect	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
vulnerable	O
customers	O

they	O
look	O
attractive	O
on	O

once	O
these	O
fraudulent	O

get	O
your	O
credit	O
card	O
details	O
you	O
are	O
wide	O
open	O
to	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
very	O
closely	O
in	O

to	O
how	O
we	O
protect	O
our	O
vulnerable	O
consumers	O
because	O
this	O

it	O

we	O
have	O
a	O
long	O

go	O

that	O

have	O
an	O

on	O

how	O
that	O

we	O
heard	O
from	O
the	O

how	O
he	O
was	O
setting	O

absolutely	O
at	O

this	O

it	O

an	O

much	O
about	O

really	O

however	O
there	O
are	O
three	B-CARDINAL
points	O
which	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
firstly	B-ORDINAL
on	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
budget	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
we	O
reflect	O
the	O
difficult	O
times	O
being	O
experienced	O
by	O
the	O
member	O

for	O
that	O
reason	O
we	O
are	O
calling	O
for	O
a	O
freeze	O
at	O
one	B-CARDINAL
gni	O
secondly	B-ORDINAL
on	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
own	O
resources	O

finally	O
i	O
recognise	O
the	O
efforts	O
which	O
are	O
being	O
made	O
towards	O
resolving	O
the	O
crisis	O
in	O
the	O
european	B-NORP
economy	O
however	O
with	O
resources	O
strictly	O
limited	O
is	O
it	O
not	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
revaluated	O
our	O
spending	O
priorities	O
for	O
the	O
european	B-GPE
union	I-GPE
budget	O

it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
tough	O
choices	O
in	O
the	O
future	O
and	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
stress	O
to	O
this	O

that	O
those	O

must	O
be	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
target	O
of	O
achieving	O
true	O
european	B-NORP

we	O
remain	O
open	O
to	O

we	O

either	O
for	O
a	O

or	O
for	O

thirdly	B-ORDINAL
on	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
the	O
rebate	O
can	O
i	O
remind	O
this	O
house	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
simply	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
mathematics	O
and	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
sentiment	O

or	O

overall	O
i	O

we	O

that	O

we	O

the	O

the	O

that	O
this	O

what	O

we	O

at	O

that	O

something	O

we	O

we	O

this	O
potential	O
is	O

quite	O
the	O

because	O
trade	O
currently	O

at	O

that	O
urgently	O

i	O

actually	O
your	O
trade	O
strategy	O

is	O
a	O
step	O
in	O
the	O
right	O

but	O
now	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
move	O
onwards	O
from	O
the	O
nice	O
words	O
about	O

instead	O
what	O
we	O

a	O
second	B-ORDINAL
goal	O
was	O
to	O

we	O

trade	O
ministers	O
at	O
the	O

if	O

in	O

and	O
protection	O
of	O

i	O

give	O
the	O

the	O

to	O
our	O

trade	O
strategies	O
by	O
politicising	O
the	O

too	O
much	O
i	O
believe	O
that	O
human	O
rights	O
and	O

are	O
not	O
contradictory	O

complementary	O
i	O
believe	O
that	O
trade	O
is	O
a	O
key	O
development	O
instrument	O
that	O
brings	O
growth	O
and	O
wealth	O
and	O
therefore	O
in	O

contributes	O
to	O
the	O

of	O

that	O
we	O
should	O
treat	O
our	O

on	O
an	O
equal	O
footing	O
and	O
that	O
this	O

will	O
bring	O
a	O
solid	O
basis	O
for	O
ongoing	O
dialogue	O
and	O

i	O
think	O
that	O

in	O
the	O

with	O
their	O

of	O

any	O
effort	O
to	O
bring	O
binding	O

to	O
impose	O

which	O
unfortunately	O
is	O
an	O

more	O
and	O
more	O
popular	O
in	O
this	O

however	O
a	O

it	O

the	O

by	O

another	O

what	O
is	O
the	O
level	O
of	O

they	O

those	O

that	O

to	O

to	O
all	O
those	O

for	O

this	O

what	O
is	O
the	O

it	O
to	O

the	O

they	O

or	O
to	O
say	O
simply	O
that	O
those	O

are	O
against	O

we	O

this	O
is	O
why	O
it	O
is	O

to	O
those	O
of	O
us	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
clearly	O
the	O

that	O
believe	O
in	O

that	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
to	O

as	O
much	O
as	O

a	O

some	O

in	O

of	O

we	O

as	O
a	O

us	O
commit	O
to	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O

and	O

it	O
is	O

just	O
a	O

once	O
again	O
let	O
me	O
make	O
clear	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
is	O
why	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
state	O
again	O
that	O
some	O

the	O

they	O
are	O
not	O

at	O
this	O

to	O
generate	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

has	O
to	O

to	O
the	O

it	O
gives	O
to	O
forging	O
this	O

one	B-CARDINAL
thing	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
you	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
clearly	O
a	O
huge	O

that	O
shares	O
european	B-NORP

and	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
a	O

that	O

that	O

the	O

that	O

should	O
take	O
up	O
our	O

in	O

than	O
we	O
do	O
today	O
we	O
have	O
of	O

after	O
the	O
very	O
difficult	O
economic	O
situation	O
taken	O
a	O
road	O
ahead	O
also	O
supported	O
by	O
this	O

a	O
road	O
of	O
reducing	O

a	O

of	O
implementing	O

a	O

also	O
a	O

of	O

we	O
cannot	O
go	O
back	O

at	O

and	O
the	O

of	O

i	O
do	O
feel	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
do	O
our	O

and	O

it	O
is	O
the	O

of	O

at	O

that	O
we	O

the	O

why	O
are	O
you	O

a	O

when	O
you	O

what	O
you	O

to	O
the	O

it	O

for	O
you	O

it	O

firstly	B-ORDINAL
not	O

mr	O

i	O

a	O

a	O

if	O

would	O
you	O
then	O
applying	O
the	O

of	O
wales	B-GPE
of	O
scotland	B-GPE
or	O
of	O
northern	B-GPE

are	O
different	O
then	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
solution	O
would	O
be	O
to	O

possibly	O

we	O

another	O

the	O

it	O
as	O

many	O
of	O
my	O

is	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
with	O

of	O

and	O
the	O

this	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
should	O
also	O
be	O

much	O

i	O
therefore	O
hope	O
that	O

the	O

not	O

to	O

but	O
also	O
to	O
his	O

higher	O
up	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
we	O
really	O
need	O
an	O

and	O
the	O
sooner	O
the	O

in	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O

for	O

is	O
not	O
only	O
unethical	O
because	O
of	O
the	O

it	O

so	O
i	O
strongly	O

that	O

in	O

fourthly	B-ORDINAL
on	O
china	B-GPE
i	O
must	O
say	O
that	O
i	O
could	O
not	O
blame	O
china	B-GPE
at	O
all	O
when	O
they	O
decided	O
to	O

it	O
will	O
change	O
the	O
market	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
need	O
a	O
sustainable	O
market	O
where	O
profit	O
is	O
coming	O
from	O
more	O
sustainable	O
behaviour	O

so	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
encourage	O
or	O
empower	O
consumers	O

if	O
you	O
are	O
as	O
old	O
as	O
i	O
am	O
you	O
can	O
remember	O
when	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
much	O
plastic	O
around	O
and	O
life	O
was	O
very	O
different	O

perhaps	O
given	O
where	O
i	O
stand	O
in	O
the	O
chamber	O
and	O
possibly	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
my	O
nationality	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
come	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
surprise	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
i	O
am	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
fan	O
as	O
the	O
two	O
previous	O
speakers	O
of	O
the	O
legislation	O

that	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
we	O
need	O
any	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
do	O
we	O
do	O
need	O
a	O
framework	O
but	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
appeal	O
for	O
that	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
light	O
as	O
possible	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
setting	O
member	O
states	O
targets	O
and	O
allowing	O
them	O
to	O
use	O
their	O
own	O
best	O
efforts	O
to	O
meet	O
those	O

i	O
can	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
uk	B-GPE
where	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
banned	O
microplastics	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
resistance	O

it	O
is	O
actually	O
the	O
functioning	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
system	O
that	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
very	O
seriously	O
so	O
i	O
thank	O
you	O
very	O
much	O

i	O
have	O
spoken	O
to	O
both	O
of	O
you	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
i	O
am	O
satisfied	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
ever	O
we	O
are	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
issue	O
with	O
a	O
holistic	O
perspective	O

it	O
could	O
be	O
that	O
i	O
come	O
from	O
an	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
mediterranean	B-LOC
and	O
that	O
makes	O
me	O
much	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
environmental	O
and	O
health	O
problems	O
that	O
plastic	O
waste	O
brings	O
i	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
our	O
opportunity	O
to	O
actually	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
put	O
environment	O
at	O
the	O
forefront	O
while	O
also	O
making	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
get	O
industry	O
on	O
board	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
remain	O
competitive	O
and	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
let	O
other	O
continents	O
run	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
competitiveness	O
stakes	O

this	O
is	O
our	O
opportunity	O
because	O
people	O
are	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
impact	O
that	O
plastic	O
has	O
not	O
only	O
on	O
our	O
environment	O
but	O
also	O
on	O
our	O
health	O

so	O
it	O
is	O
great	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
commitment	O
from	O
the	O
commission	O
and	O
leafing	O
through	O
the	O
strategy	O
i	O
must	O
say	O
the	O
analysis	O
is	O
very	O
strong	O
the	O
language	O
is	O
right	O
and	O
the	O
intentions	O
are	O
very	O
very	O
promising	O

not	O
only	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
political	O
body	O
that	O
can	O
propose	O
legislative	O
proposals	O

i	O
know	O
some	O
elements	O
are	O
technically	O
difficult	O
setting	O
common	O
standards	O
for	O
biodegradable	O
plastics	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
and	O
i	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
huge	O
scientific	O
debate	O
behind	O
that	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
other	O
elements	O
that	O
are	O
much	O
less	O
complicated	O
and	O
that	O
have	O
already	O
been	O
considered	O
by	O
the	O
commission	O
for	O
years	O
and	O
years	O
even	O
by	O
previous	O
commissioners	O

that	O
has	O
been	O
done	O
the	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
so	O
concluding	O
i	O
'm	O
very	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O
strategy	O
but	O
i	O
had	O
expected	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
legislative	O
part	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
your	O

is	O
to	O
come	O

with	O
those	O
please	O

so	O
during	O
your	O

because	O
if	O
it	O

left	O
to	O
the	O

we	O

if	O
the	O

that	O

we	O
could	O

then	O
an	O

three	B-CARDINAL

of	O
all	O

dissent	O

if	O
ever	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
subsidiarity	O
issue	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
it	O

my	O
second	B-ORDINAL
reason	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
new	O

of	O

the	O
alarming	O
prospect	O
of	O
in	O

that	O

clearly	O
that	O
the	O

because	O
the	O

because	O

not	O

enough	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
we	O

not	O

that	O

of	O

we	O

that	O

for	O
us	O

we	O
do	O
not	O
agree	O
to	O

the	O

we	O
should	O
be	O
careful	O
because	O
the	O

on	O
these	O

delay	O
the	O

of	O

we	O

any	O

my	O

meeting	O

over	B-DATE
the	I-DATE

my	O
general	O
point	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
believe	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
freedom	O
of	O
religion	O
and	O
belief	O
whatever	O
that	O
religion	O
or	O
belief	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
that	O

we	O
do	O
indeed	O
hence	O
i	O
know	O
about	O
the	O
weekly	O
reports	O

however	O
the	O
honourable	O
gentleman	O
is	O
completely	O
right	O
that	O
the	O
significant	O
part	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
people	O
's	O

are	O
not	O
violated	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
ensure	O
humanitarian	O

is	O
given	O

very	O
finally	O
i	O
have	O
not	O
made	O
any	O
decision	O
about	O
opening	O
a	O
delegation	O
in	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
build	O
alliances	O
on	O
human	O
rights	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O

we	O
can	O

that	O

to	O
those	O

who	O
specifically	O
talked	O
about	O
freedom	O
of	O
religion	O
and	O
belief	O
let	O
me	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
say	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
indeed	O
talk	O
about	O
the	O
terrible	O
tragedies	O
for	O
christian	B-NORP
communities	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O

where	O
these	O

occur	O

if	O
i	O
might	O
just	O
finish	O
with	O
this	O
i	O
was	O
very	O
taken	O
by	O
what	O
mr	O

said	O
when	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
human	O

is	O
a	O
way	O
of	O

in	O
my	O
conversations	O
on	O
this	O
i	O
am	O
also	O
clear	O
on	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
think	O
better	O
and	O
more	O
creatively	O
about	O
how	O
we	O
operate	O
in	O
geneva	B-GPE

it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
we	O

when	O
you	O

this	O

a	O

a	O

this	O

to	O
those	O

that	O

on	O

in	O

these	O

perhaps	O
that	O

be	O

that	O

the	O

about	O

in	O
these	O

the	O

something	O
that	O

in	O
a	O

so	O
i	O

that	O
we	O
can	O
indeed	O

the	O

two	I-LAW

is	O
necessary	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
because	O
the	O
present	O
regulation	O
is	O
being	O
abused	O
by	O
airlines	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
being	O
assisted	O
in	O
that	O
abuse	O
by	O
national	O
regulators	O
who	O
have	O
completely	O
abdicated	O
their	O

and	O
encouraged	O
through	O

the	O

to	O
drive	O

through	O
this	O

the	O

the	O

you	O

this	O

i	O
say	O
to	O
this	O

today	B-DATE

to	O
the	O

out	O

that	O

should	O

finally	O
can	O
i	O
thank	O

for	O
showing	O

this	O

a	O

three	B-TIME

this	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

which	O
was	O

the	O

that	O

this	O

the	O

that	O

by	O

that	O

this	O

would	O
give	O

by	O
ensuring	O
that	O

receive	O
the	O

to	O

as	O

it	O
would	O
also	O
extend	O
the	O

in	O
these	O

and	O
emphasise	O

in	O
situations	O
where	O

go	O
out	O

this	O
is	O
positive	O

we	O
must	O
however	O
recognise	O
the	O
opportunities	O
that	O
our	O

bring	O
for	O

it	O
is	O

that	O

to	O
thank	O
ms	O

very	O
much	O
for	O
her	O

i	O
believe	O
that	O
much	O
sustainable	O
forest	O

is	O
currently	O
being	O
constrained	O
by	O
wellmeaning	O
but	O
overly	O
prescriptive	O
and	O
bureaucratic	O
environmental	O
legislation	O
and	O
that	O
includes	O
things	O
like	O
the	O
eu	B-LAW

so	O
i	O
welcome	O
the	O
report	O
's	O
emphasis	O
on	O
the	O
upcoming	O
review	O
of	O
that	O
regulation	O
and	O
a	O
call	O
for	O
a	O

that	O
reduces	O
unnecessary	O
costs	O
and	O
reporting	O
requirements	O
for	O
europe	B-LOC
's	O
foresters	O

i	O
do	O
understand	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
apply	O
the	O
regulation	O
to	O
third	B-ORDINAL
country	O
imports	O
but	O
a	O
blanket	O
approach	O
in	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
is	O
not	O
necessary	O

families	O

friends	O
are	O

for	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

greece	B-GPE
really	O
is	O
one	B-CARDINAL
of	O
the	O
hotspots	O
of	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
climate	O

that	O
we	O

all	O
over	O
europe	B-LOC

the	O
commissioner	O
has	O
already	O
outlined	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
issues	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
also	O
engage	O
in	O
the	O
long	O

to	O
help	O
rebuild	O
apart	O
from	O
the	O

that	O

we	O
also	O
have	O
severe	O

to	O

all	O
those	O
prevention	O
measures	O
will	O
become	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
important	O
as	O
we	O
see	O
climate	O
change	O
progressing	O

so	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
smart	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O

are	O
not	O

that	O
no	O
damage	O
is	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
catastrophe	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
focus	O
on	O
prevention	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
don	O
't	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
sorry	O
for	O

later	O
on	O

their	O

sadly	O
in	O

it	O

this	O
they	O

let	O
me	O

start	O
with	O
the	O

whether	O
europe	B-LOC

we	O
were	O
the	O

to	O
mobilise	O
attention	O
to	O
this	O

the	O
answer	O
is	O
no	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
why	O
we	O

to	O
make	O
every	O

to	O
fight	O
ebola	O
at	O

do	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
most	O

we	O

at	O
the	O
moment	O
there	O
is	O
very	O

deployment	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
developed	O
in	O

so	O
that	O
we	O

to	O

i	O
want	O
to	O
praise	O
our	O

in	O
the	B-DATE

we	O

some	O

austria	B-GPE

italy	B-GPE
with	O
a	O
field	O

i	O
could	O
not	O
agree	O
more	O
that	O
coordination	O
saves	O

fight	O
the	O
bigger	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
this	O

it	O

at	O

it	O

it	O
that	O
this	O

more	O

ever	O

we	O

today	B-DATE
they	O

the	O

what	O

to	O

in	O
terms	O
of	O
stopping	O
populism	O

on	O

we	O
also	O
urgently	O
need	O
answers	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
that	O
your	O
recipe	O
of	O
simply	O
collecting	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
data	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

and	O
yes	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
prosecute	O
those	O
who	O
pose	O
a	O
real	O
threat	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
our	O
way	O
of	O
life	O
absolutely	O
but	O
we	O
also	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
further	O
into	O
the	O
root	O
causes	O
of	O
radicalisation	O
so	O
that	O
fewer	O
people	O
become	O
a	O
threat	O
to	O
our	O
security	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
freedom	O

but	O
rather	O
than	O
doing	O
that	O
and	O
wasting	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
pooling	O
and	O
sharing	O
the	O
rule	O
and	O
not	O
the	O
exception	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
super	O
disappointing	O
that	O
the	O
council	B-ORG
has	O
dropped	O
any	O
progress	O
on	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
solidarity	O
from	O
the	O
agenda	O
and	O
i	O
am	O
afraid	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
cannot	O
even	O
solve	O
that	O
task	O
then	O
i	O
really	O
have	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
imagining	O
how	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
progress	O
in	O
other	O
areas	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
satisfactory	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
reason	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
that	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
strengthen	O
the	O
exchange	O
of	O
data	O
on	O
actual	O
suspects	O
and	O
unknown	O
risk	O
persons	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
tools	O
that	O
we	O
already	O
have	O
today	O
actually	O
serve	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
our	O
citizens	O

your	O
answer	O
to	O
conflicts	O
and	O
violence	O
worldwide	O
is	O
just	O
to	O
push	O
for	O
more	O
military	O
spending	O

for	O
solving	O
problems	O
you	O
would	O
actually	O
need	O
to	O
tackle	O
their	O
root	O
causes	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
root	O
cause	O
for	O
why	O
people	O
have	O
to	O
flee	O
and	O
do	O
something	O
about	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
not	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
that	O
particular	O
industry	O
really	O
needs	O
that	O
extra	O
bit	O
of	O
help	O
but	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
actually	O
doing	O
here	O
or	O
what	O
we	O
would	O
be	O
doing	O
here	O
is	O
actually	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
twenty	B-ORDINAL

or	O
twenty	B-ORDINAL
eighth	I-ORDINAL
sort	O
of	O
defence	O
policy	O

this	O
sort	O
of	O

could	O
actually	O
save	O
us	O
something	O
like	O
eur	B-MONEY
one	I-MONEY

every	O

that	O

all	O
the	O
root	O

of	O

for	O

in	O

i	O
wish	O
the	O

and	O
come	O
up	O
with	O

that	O

we	O

to	O

that	O
the	O

that	O

there	O

a	O

at	O

the	O

a	O
british	B-NORP

with	O
a	O

the	O

in	O

the	O

what	O

that	O
the	O

we	O
always	O
say	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
time	O
is	O
now	O
right	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
receive	O
from	O
the	O
british	B-NORP
side	O
clear	O

to	O
these	O
five	B-CARDINAL
questions	O
so	O
that	O
these	O

because	O
of	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
that	O

been	O
created	O

the	O
second	B-ORDINAL
question	O
is	O
will	O
it	O
be	O
the	O
opinion	O

the	O

or	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O

or	O
national	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
moment	O
is	O
now	O
there	O
when	O
we	O
start	O
these	O
brexit	B-EVENT

to	O

the	O

that	O

what	O

some	O
say	O
shale	O
but	O
the	O

say	O
no	O

we	O

we	O

the	O

we	O

therefore	O
the	O

and	O
my	O

to	O

is	O
what	O

some	O
people	O
will	O
say	O
nuclear	O
but	O
the	O
greens	B-ORG

no	O

that	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
pro	O

not	O
necessarily	O
pro	O
big	O

we	O

we	O
need	O

not	O
against	O
it	O

of	O
course	O

surely	O
we	O
can	O
agree	O
on	O
less	O
waste	O
in	O
landfill	O

otherwise	O
we	O
will	O
never	O
solve	O
this	O
challenge	O
it	O
is	O
time	O
to	O
reclaim	O
the	O

those	O

that	O
being	O

pro	O

two	B-CARDINAL

of	O

we	O
can	O

climate	O

policy	O
must	O
be	O

we	O

from	O
the	O

that	O
we	O
have	O
a	O

it	O

that	O

on	O
the	O

we	O

we	O

the	O

might	O

that	O

and	O
in	O
this	O

we	O
must	O

that	O
the	O

to	O
adjust	O

to	O
rapidly	O

so	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
we	O

that	O

that	O
there	O
are	O
obvious	O

between	O

facets	O
of	O

so	O
we	O

into	O
the	O

in	O

terrorists	O
and	O
ensure	O
that	O

contribute	O
to	O

that	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
consider	O
that	O

should	O
not	O
be	O

the	O

we	O
take	O
our	O

it	O

shows	O
that	O
we	O

serious	O
that	O
our	O

about	O

becomes	O
our	O

this	O

what	O
our	O

that	O
we	O
take	O

very	O

i	O

very	O

to	O

a	O

and	O
we	O
in	O

we	O

it	O
is	O
good	O
to	O

such	O
a	O
coming	O
together	O
of	O

which	O
have	O

at	O

if	O

on	O
this	O
without	O

they	O
will	O
of	O

always	O
have	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O

that	O
is	O
what	O
we	O

the	O
future	O
regulation	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
already	O
constitutes	O
a	O
fair	O
compromise	O
which	O
the	O
uk	B-GPE
and	O
ireland	B-GPE
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
accept	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
substantial	O
benefits	O
in	O
it	O
for	O
their	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
important	O
that	O
notaries	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
participating	O

will	O
be	O

and	O
will	O
inform	O
their	O
clients	O
about	O
the	O
new	O
possibilities	O
available	O
to	O
them	O

i	O
am	O
sure	O
this	O
is	O
one	B-CARDINAL
of	O
the	O
points	O
we	O
can	O
put	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
during	O
the	O
european	B-EVENT
year	I-EVENT
of	I-EVENT
citizens	I-EVENT
in	O
order	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
yes	O
we	O
care	O
for	O
citizens	O

i	O
absolutely	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
that	O
the	O
text	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
under	O
discussion	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
much	O
improved	O
thanks	O
to	O
the	O
arduous	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
and	O
the	O
committee	O

i	O
am	O
very	O
much	O
aware	O
that	O
succession	O
is	O
a	O
delicate	O
sensitive	O
area	O
which	O
is	O
intrinsically	O
linked	O
to	O
national	O
policies	O
on	O
family	O
protection	O
and	O
judicial	O
systems	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
considerable	O
differences	O
between	O
the	O
national	O
laws	O
but	O
fortunately	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
wonderful	O
rapporteur	O
mr	O
lechner	B-PERSON

this	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
people	O
because	O
around	O
ten	B-CARDINAL
of	O
the	O
total	O
number	O
of	O
successions	O
in	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE

an	O

i	O
think	O
mr	O

with	O
this	O

you	O

left	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

mr	O

believe	O
me	O
i	O
am	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
this	O
proposal	O
is	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

because	O

long	O
time	O
for	O
too	O
long	O

the	O

which	O
is	O
for	O

tomorrow	B-DATE
maintains	O
the	O
main	O
policy	O
objectives	O
set	O
for	O
the	O

namely	O
that	O
successions	O
will	O
be	O
governed	O
by	O
one	B-CARDINAL

law	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
of	O
habitual	O

of	O
the	O

people	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
plan	O
their	O

in	O

by	O

the	O

of	O
their	O

of	O

wherever	O
they	O
move	O
in	O
the	O
european	B-GPE

and	O
there	O
will	O

the	O

about	O
eur	B-MONEY
one	I-MONEY

so	O
this	O

that	O

to	O

this	O
was	O
one	B-CARDINAL
of	O
the	O

i	O
wanted	O

with	O
him	O

i	O
note	O
that	O
there	O
remain	O
concerns	O
within	O

in	O
the	O

regarding	O
other	O
aspects	O

three	B-CARDINAL

of	O
the	O
uk	B-GPE
population	O
comes	O
from	O
another	O

and	O
i	O
consider	O
that	O
the	O
failure	O
to	O
resolve	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
clawback	O
is	O
a	O
fundamental	O
flaw	O
in	O
the	O
final	O

as	O
it	O
will	O
close	O
off	O
its	O

to	O
a	O

and	O
conversely	O
the	O
large	O

can	O
i	O
also	O
express	O
my	O
real	O
disappointment	O
at	O
the	O
decision	O
in	O
the	O
council	B-ORG
whereby	O
the	O

found	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
where	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
opt	O
into	O
this	O
regulation	O

practices	O
vary	O
widely	O
across	O
the	O
european	B-GPE
union	I-GPE
in	O
this	O
area	O
and	O
we	O
must	O
consider	O
whether	O
the	O
final	O
article	O
agreed	O
between	O

will	O
meet	O
the	O

i	O
thank	O
him	O

the	O

a	O

the	O
danger	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
lead	O
to	O
an	O
eu	B-GPE
law	O
of	O

an	O

the	O

now	O
i	O
doubt	O
that	O
many	O
people	O
in	O
england	B-GPE
realise	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
debating	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
's	O
intention	O
to	O
take	O
control	O
of	O
inheritance	O
law	O

the	O
one	B-CARDINAL
good	O
thing	O
i	O
can	O
say	O
about	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
british	B-NORP
government	O
has	O
exercised	O
its	O
opt	O
out	O

anyway	O
some	O
meps	O
might	O
like	O
to	O
consider	O
the	O
wisdom	O
of	O
handing	O
yet	O
more	O
control	O
to	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
in	O
this	O
area	O
and	O
vote	O
with	O
meps	O
from	O
the	O
uk	B-ORG
independence	I-ORG
party	I-ORG
against	O
it	O

there	O
will	O
be	O
differences	O
because	O
countries	O
are	O
located	O
differently	O
geographically	O

i	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
about	O
the	O
eurema	O
scheme	O
in	O
malta	B-GPE

therefore	O
we	O
will	O
always	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
prepared	O
for	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
solidarity	O
mechanism	O
or	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
assistance	O

we	O
could	O
identify	O
that	O
and	O
mobilise	O
a	O
whole	O
range	O
of	O
tools	O
to	O
alleviate	O
the	O
pressure	O

there	O
are	O
histories	O
in	O
different	O
member	O

there	O
is	O
the	O
reputation	O
issue	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
could	O
achieve	O
the	O
same	O
goals	O
by	O
setting	O
up	O
this	O
forum	O
with	O
the	O
commission	O
together	O
with	O
easo	B-ORG
and	O
other	O
experts	O
giving	O
regular	O
reports	O
convening	O
the	O
forum	O
and	O
identifying	O
where	O
the	O
needs	O
are	O
the	O
biggest	O
and	O
hopefully	O
member	O
states	O
could	O
pledge	O
the	O
places	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
help	O
and	O
show	O
solidarity	O
we	O
have	O
set	O
aside	O
specific	O
lump	O
sums	O
for	O
that	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
provide	O
also	O
the	O
economic	O
possibilities	O
for	O
solidarity	O
and	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
experience	O
the	O
know	O
how	O
and	O
the	O
best	O
practices	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
gained	O
from	O
eurema	O
i	O
think	O
this	O
could	O
be	O
almost	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
a	O
permanent	O
legislative	O

it	O
was	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
get	O
member	O

to	O
pledge	O
places	O
very	O
difficult	O
and	O
as	O
you	O
saw	O
only	O
fourteen	B-CARDINAL
people	O
have	O
been	O
relocated	O
through	O
that	O
scheme	O
when	O
as	O
i	O
told	O
you	O
we	O
discussed	O
with	O
the	O
ministers	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
setting	O
up	O
a	O

such	O
as	O
you	O
are	O
asking	O
for	O
a	O
legislative	O
permanent	O
scheme	O
only	O
a	O

of	O

were	O
in	O

a	O

not	O
the	O

today	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
possible	O
to	O

such	O
a	O

but	O
again	O
there	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
mechanism	O

of	O
course	O
in	O
the	O
medium	O
term	O
this	O
will	O
mean	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
distribute	O
the	O

a	O
little	O
better	O
in	O
the	O
european	B-GPE

and	O
that	O
we	O

however	O
there	O
will	O

be	O

as	O
the	O

we	O

such	O
a	O

that	O
i	O
certainly	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
every	O

who	O
has	O
posed	O
a	O

that	O
we	O
will	O
come	O
back	O
individually	O
to	O
those	O

which	O
i	O
cannot	O

i	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O
as	O
well	O

we	O
have	O
lots	O
of	O
experience	O
with	O
microcredit	O
outside	O
the	O
european	B-GPE

and	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
gaining	O
in	O
importance	O
within	O
it	O
as	O
well	O
i	O
have	O
heard	O
well	O
that	O
you	O
encourage	O
us	O
to	O
take	O
more	O

there	O
is	O
one	B-CARDINAL
big	O

that	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
focus	O
of	O
the	O
discussions	O
in	O
washington	B-GPE
last	O

and	O
that	O
is	O
climate	O

and	O
i	O
can	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
is	O
not	O
necessarily	O
getting	O
any	O
more	O
favourable	O
to	O
these	O

finally	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
questions	O
of	O

are	O
always	O
of	O

importance	O
and	O
so	O
are	O
questions	O
of	O
transparency	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
issues	O
are	O
really	O
of	O
key	O
importance	O
for	O
me	O
now	O
because	O
i	O
heard	O
the	O
words	O

and	O
coordination	O
again	O

again	O
and	O
i	O
can	O
report	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
in	O

but	O
we	O

the	O

this	O

would	O

they	O

in	O
this	O

we	O

that	O

on	O
the	O

is	O
right	O
and	O
needs	O

we	O
must	O
make	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
we	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
ultimately	O
achieve	O
a	O

and	O
assist	O
the	O

their	O

we	O
need	O
to	O

that	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
peaceful	O
political	O
transition	O
to	O

led	O
and	O
owned	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O

free	O
from	O

we	O
have	O

one	O
cannot	O
but	O
recognise	O
that	O
so	O
far	O
these	O
attempts	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
successful	O
but	O
that	O
must	O
not	O
prevent	O
the	O
european	B-GPE

from	O
maintaining	O
close	O

with	O
those	O

play	O
a	O

role	O
in	O
the	O
evolution	O
of	O
syria	B-GPE

let	O
me	O
be	O
very	O
clear	O

importantly	O
we	O
have	O
introduced	O
an	O
embargo	O
on	O
the	O
import	O
of	O
syrian	B-NORP
oil	O

we	O
expect	O
it	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
major	O
impact	O
on	O
the	O
regime	O
's	O
financial	O
situation	O
since	O
the	O
eu	B-GPE
consumes	O
more	O
than	O
ninety	B-CARDINAL

the	O

i	O
am	O
pleased	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

has	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
accompany	O
its	O
strong	O
position	O
with	O
adequate	O
actions	O

finally	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
forget	O
about	O
syria	B-GPE
's	O
future	O

rightly	O
we	O
ask	O
questions	O
about	O
what	O
comes	O
next	O
and	O
what	O
it	O
will	O
mean	O
for	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

the	O

whether	O

it	O

a	O

it	O

properly	O
why	O
we	O
have	O
taken	O
all	O
these	O
actions	O
against	O

given	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O

public	O

the	O

stopped	O
its	O

and	O
nearly	O
every	O

we	O
hear	O
reports	O
of	O
syrians	B-NORP
being	O
killed	O
injured	O
detained	O
or	O

we	O
must	O
also	O
reach	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
countries	O
of	O
the	O
region	O
which	O
have	O
increasingly	O
expressed	O
concern	O
about	O
the	O
present	O
situation	O
in	O
syria	B-GPE

of	O
course	O
this	O
is	O
ironic	O
given	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

given	O
huge	O

to	O

in	O

syria	B-GPE

sadly	O
al	B-PERSON

knows	O
that	O
we	O

operation	O
on	O

we	O
can	O
state	O
our	O
revulsion	O
at	O
assad	B-PERSON

and	O
we	O
can	O
apply	O

from	O
european	B-NORP

and	O

which	O
are	O

and	O
we	O
can	O
treat	O
the	O

as	O
the	O
pariahs	O
that	O
they	O

since	O
this	O

concerning	O
china	B-GPE

i	O
just	O
want	O
to	O

and	O
confirm	O
that	O
of	O

the	O
syrian	B-NORP
issue	O
is	O
raised	O
in	O
all	O
meetings	O
with	O
those	O
partners	O
so	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
doubt	O
about	O
our	O
commitment	O
to	O
bringing	O
all	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
on	O

we	O
have	O
to	O
act	O
against	O
the	O
regime	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
so	O
it	O
is	O
essential	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
talk	O
about	O

we	O
understand	O
what	O
effects	O
those	O
sanctions	O
may	O
have	O
on	O
the	O
population	O
i	O
could	O
referring	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
arguments	O
that	O
were	O
made	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
list	O
of	O
the	O
sanctions	O
we	O
have	O
imposed	O
and	O
yes	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
confirm	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
even	O
further	O

but	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
measure	O
those	O
sanctions	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
way	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
harm	O
the	O
population	O
but	O
to	O
make	O
life	O
difficult	O
for	O
the	O
regime	O

i	O
also	O
want	O
to	O
emphasise	O
once	O
again	O
the	O
need	O
for	O
unity	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
and	O
a	O
strict	O
message	O
of	O
non	O

of	O

this	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
very	O

on	O
some	O

the	O
eu	B-GPE

up	O

we	O

so	O
we	O
